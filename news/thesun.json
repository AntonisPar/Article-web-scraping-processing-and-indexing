There were 127 deaths recorded in the UK today bringing the total number to 145,551 since the beginning of the pandemic.  It is the lowest number of deaths the UK has had on a Saturday in the past two months after 121 deaths were recorded on October 2. In comparison, on November 13 there were 157 deaths and 150 on November 20. And according to today's figures, there were 42,848 new cases recorded in the past 24 hour after yesterday's infection toll hit 50,584. The total number of infections now stands at 10,421,104. It comes as the Omicron variant has been spreading throughout Britain in the past few weeks. There have been 104 Omicron cases in England with¬†more than half found in double jabbed. The number of Omicron cases in the UK has risen to 134 - including the first confirmed case in Wales. üîµ Read our Omicron variant live blog for the latest news It comes amid fears Christmas could be cancelled in a bid to stop the spread of the Omicron variant.  However, Boris Johnson, 57, insisted there was no need to cancel Xmas gatherings, family meet-ups or nativity plays. He begged confused Brits not to panic¬†as he sought to calm the chaos by saying of the tougher restrictions claims: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need for that at all. That‚Äôs not what we are saying. ‚ÄúPlease, we‚Äôve got to take a balanced and proportionate approach to this. We want people to continue as they are.‚Äù Tory chief Oliver Dowden urged Brits to¬†go to the pub¬†and insisted people must \"keep calm and carry on.\" Meanwhile, the WHO has revealed that no one has died from the Omicron variant even though cases have been detected in 38 across the world. Government advisors have suggested the¬†work from home advice should return¬†in a bid to prevent the spread of Omicron as it could spark a new wave of cases. The government has extended its booster campaign to¬†18-39 year-olds¬†in order to get on the front foot of Omicron infections and to give Brits as much protection as possible.

In the video, around eight boys can be seen kneeling with their heads bowed on the pavement, while a member of school staff wearing a hi-vis jacket appears to watch over them. After finishing their prayer, the boys, wearing their blazers and school shoes, quickly stand up and start picking up their school bags. The footage prompted widespread anger online, with furious viewers slamming the scenes as \"distressing\" and \"disgusting\". The school in Greater Manchester has since explained the students were unable to pray inside because of severe flooding which affected 15 classrooms.¬† They have issued a \"wholehearted apology\" and confirmed an investigation has been launched. One former student told¬†The Oldham Times¬†the boys were praying during their lunch break in a classroom when a member of staff \"told them to leave\". It was claimed the students were left with no other option but to conduct their prayers outside in the cold because the school had not offered them a prayer room. According to¬†Asian Image, a pupil claiming to be involved in the incident said an \"angry\" teacher told the group they were not allowed to pray in the room they were in. The student said: \"We were praying Jummah and a teacher came in and told us we aren‚Äôt allowed to pray in that room and she slammed the door and seemed angry.¬† \"We have had a prayer room for a long time, teachers would allow us to go there for our prayers.\"¬† Oldham Council leader, Arooj Shah, said: \"When we were made aware of the issues raised at the Oldham Academy North, we acted quickly to speak with the school to understand what had happened. \"Having spoken with the school leaders I am glad they have apologised to those who were affected and will be writing to parents to explain. \"Oldham is a proud and diverse borough and I know that the Oldham Academy North sees this as a strength for the school. \"We will continue conversations with the school around this matter to investigate the situation properly.\" Oldham Mosques council development officer, Mufti Helal Mahmood, said they will be \"working closely with Oldham Academy North to ensure incidents like this can be avoided in the future\". According to Manchester Evening News, the school said in a statement: \"Earlier this week photos on social media began to circulate of students at the Oldham Academy North praying outside. \"The Oldham Academy North, Oldham Interfaith Forum and Oldham Council would like to address the understandable concern this has caused. \"Firstly, the academy would like to offer a wholehearted apology. \"The school is proud of its diversity and would never stop students from praying or ask them to pray outside. \"This situation arose due to a lack of space in the school, caused by a flood which created a huge amount of damage and made 15 rooms unusable. \"A room has since been found for students to pray in, and we understand they are happy with the space. \"The academy is writing to parents today to fully explain what has happened, and are happy to meet with any members of the community who are concerned.\"", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16939826/boy-dies-sepsis-sent-home-from-hospital/": "Theodore Paul Cheetham-Serjent, known as Theo, was taken to hospital by his mum, Paula, after he had a temperature, cold feet and diarrhoea. The inquest was told that trainee doctor, Grace Olowonyo, examined Theo and diagnosed gastroenteritis. But when the family returned to their home in Wigan, Theo began vomiting, so Paula called an ambulance. When paramedics arrived, they gave Theo antibiotics as they suspected sepsis, Manchester Evening News reports. Theo was then intubated, but he suffered a heart attack at 8:20am on December 30, 2019.  He was resuscitated, but half an hour later suffered a second cardiac arrest and died at 9:03am. Mr Brennand, sitting at Bolton Coroners' Court, Greater Manchester said: \"The cause of Theo's death was septicaemia\" (Neisseria¬†meningitis¬†Type B.) He added: \"It is my view and my finding that the decision and the presumptive diagnosis that was made at the first presentation by Dr Olowonyo was not unreasonable in the circumstances. \"It was, of course, as we now know, an entirely erroneous diagnosis.\" Dr Olowony did not seek a second opinion from senior colleagues, request a blood test or take a stool sample - which could have diagnosed sepsis - but other doctors told the inquest they would have done the same as their colleague. Coroner Timothy Brennand said despite the family's criticism, Dr Olowony's diagnosis was not \"unreasonable in the circumstances.\" In a GoFundMe tribute page, Alysha Elizabeth Hampson said: \"Our hearts are broken, my beautiful, gentle baby brother passed away from meningococcal meningitis. \"We are beyond devastated, it's so cruel.  \"Theo was loved by anyone who met him, the cutest smile, the sweetest voice and the gentlest soul, we miss him so much.\" Dr Wayne Heaven, a consultant in emergency medicine, said all [medics] believed that the diagnosis was appropriate, given Theo's symptoms.\" Theo's mum Paula described her son as \"quite an astonishing little boy\" and a \"much-anticipated\" addition to the family. Mr Brennand added: \"Where there is any doubt and room for doubt it is always safer and far more advisable to cross-check and ask of other more senior clinicians so that there is a confirmation in relation to the correctness of the differential diagnosis. \"This seems to me an exaltation in common sense. \"That didn't happen in this case and the reason it didn't happen was that Dr Olowonyo was convinced in her own mind that she had made the correct diagnosis. \"That is a decision which she will have to live with and consequences of which the family will have to endure for the remainder of their days.\" Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?

The money sat in her bank for over a year while she waited for the taxman to notice its mistake and claw it back. She says she struggled to contact HMRC, thanks to lengthy call wait times. The woman, who is unnamed, told the Guardian: \"I even tried to ring HMRC but getting hold of anyone at the time was impossible.  \"I‚Äôd wait 30 minutes on the phone and then would have to give up as my child would need to be fed, or something... On other calls, I would be cut off before I could talk to someone.\" Despite knowing she would have to pay all the windfall back at some stage and wanting to return it, she started dipping into the balance and spent almost ¬£20,000. She says her income was decimated by Covid and she found that she was gently eating into the cash that HMRC left in her account. Knowing she'd have to eventually pay the money back, the mum started to panic and even considered investing some of the cash in cryptocurrency to claw back what she'd spent. She did transfer ¬£100,000 into a savings account, but she says the interest has been insignificant. She said: \"Because I could no longer pay the whole sum back I was stuck in a catch-22 position. I had a whole load of money I knew I couldn‚Äôt spend, but I was unable to do anything about it in case HMRC wanted it all back at once.‚Äù Under UK law, you're not allowed to spend any of the cash if you have an unexpected windfall. In fact, if money is transferred into your account unexpectedly and you use it, you could be charged with ‚Äòretaining wrongful credit' under the Theft Act 1968. You could even get in trouble for just leaving it there if you know it shouldn't be in your account. Instead, you're expected to take steps reasonable steps to cancel the transfer or return it. A Guardian investigator who spoke with HMRC discovered the money was paid in by mistake when a staff member was trying to pay a ¬£23.99 parcel duty rebate. Fortunately, HMRC has said that it wants to be supportive in this case, and has offered to set up a payment plan so the woman can give back the ¬£20,000 she spent over time. She's offered to pay it back over five years, and a debt management adviser will work with her to work out suitable and affordable repayments. If you find cash unexpectedly in your bank - don't touch it. Legally you have to pay it all back, even if you've spent it. Instead, you should inform your bank immediately, as it may be able to refund the money. If you know where the money has come from, take steps to get in contact with the sender and alert them to their mistake. If you spend any money knowing it's not yours, you face a maximum sentence of ten years in prison and may also have to pay a heft fine. People have been jailed before after going on spending sprees with accidental windfalls. For instance, a dad of two was jailed for 14 months after spending ¬£10k windfall that was sent to him in error by his bank. An ex-carer was given a suspended sentence after using a ¬£600k council windfall to clear his debts and support charity work. And a grandfather was ordered to repay ¬£110,000, which he'd spent after his bank had mistakenly told him he could keep it. If you're worried about spending it - it might make sense to move it into an easy access savings account, such as one linked to your bank account. This could help make sure you don't eat into it accidentally. which is easily done if it sits in your usual current account and it's not unusual for you to go overdrawn. It needs to be an account you can remove the money from at any time for when you're asked to pay it back, but you might get to keep any interest earned in that time.

His \"pitiless\" dad Hughes was caged for 21 years after being found guilty of manslaughter. Solihull MP Julian Knight confirmed he will refer the sentences on Monday morning to the Attorney General. It comes as... They will then be considered under the unduly lenient scheme and could be increased. Mr Knight said: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a palpable sense of real loss and tragedy over this and also, frankly, a sense of anger, and questions over how this was allowed to happen, how these monsters were allowed to inflict this horrible torture on this young, defenceless boy. ‚ÄúMy view is very simple on this. We need to get to the bottom of how this happened and we need to ensure that those who have failed him are accountable. ‚ÄúBut also I think anyone reflecting on those sentences yesterday thinks that they were too lenient and my intention is to refer this to the unduly lenient sentencing scheme as soon as possible and I will be doing that on Monday morning.‚Äù Hughes and Tustin¬†waged a sick \"campaign of cruelty\"¬†against¬†Arthur¬†in his tragic final months. The youngster was segregated for 14 hours a day and forced to sleep on the floor in a brutal struggle that matched the ‚Äúmedical definition of child torture‚Äù. He was also poisoned with so much salt he was too weak to even put up a fight against his torturers' horrific abuse. On June 16 last year, Tustin repeatedly smashed the youngster's head against a hard surface causing him to collapse. He died in hospital the next day from a \"head trauma inflicted on him by an adult\" consistent with being \"vigorously shaken and his head banged repeatedly against a hard surface\". Arthur's frail and skeletal body was covered with 130 bruises and he suffered 93 different areas of injury - including on his head, arms, legs, feet and torso. Even if just half of the 130 bruises on Arthur's body were the result of abuse, it would still be a mark for every day he spent being \"terrorised\" during lockdown. The injuries were so severe they were likened to those seen in a high-speed car crash. Chillingly, Arthur's final months on earth were captured in harrowing audio clips and recordings made by Tustin and Hughes. Arthur could be heard wailing in one 23-second recording \"no one loves me\" and \"no one is going to feed me\". Video footage also showed Arthur hours before he died waking up on the living room floor. The emaciated youngster was said to be so frail he could barely pick up his bedding. In his closing speech, prosecutor Jonas Hankin QC said Tustin and Hughes carried out a \"systematic course of conduct designed to terrorise, degrade, neglect and harm Arthur physically and psychologically\". He added: \"Together they denigrated and debased him, they dehumanised him.\" A serious case review has now been launched following the \"terrible tragedy\", Solihull Council confirmed. It can also be revealed Tustin was already known to children‚Äôs services over previous concerns of domestic violence. And the mum had a police reprimand for battery when she was aged 14 as well as a caution for shoplifting when aged 16. Boris Johnson's spokesman said today: \"The Prime Minister found the details of this case deeply disturbing. His thoughts are with those who loved Arthur. \"No child should ever suffer in the way that he did. And it's clear there are questions that need to be answered to get to the bottom of how this happened.\" Tustin was also convicted of two counts of child cruelty, including salt-poisoning and withholding food and drink from Arthur. Partway through the trial, she admitted two other cruelty counts - wilfully assaulting Arthur on three occasions and isolating him. Hughes was also convicted of the cruelty offences which Tustin had admitted - but was cleared of withholding food and drink, or of poisoning his own son with salt.", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16939749/video-arthur-football-dream-murder/": "The innocent six-year-old lounges comfortably on a sofa as he tells his beloved uncle Daniel Hughes how he wants to play for Liverpool then Tottenham.

He was starved, poisoned with salt and eventually beaten to death after being tortured in his final months. But the cheeky little boy grinning in the video as he plays with his superhero toys is a world away from the emaciated and broken boy seen in cruel clips recorded by his tormenters.

His plea comes as football fans around the country clapped for Arthur today in a touching sixth-minute tribute - one minute for each year of his short life.

The youngster was segregated for 14 hours a day and forced to sleep on the floor in a brutal struggle that matched the ‚Äúmedical definition of child torture‚Äù. He was also poisoned with so much salt he was too weak to even put up a fight against his torturers' horrific abuse. On June 16 last year, Tustin repeatedly smashed the youngster's head against a hard surface causing him to collapse. He died in hospital the next day from a \"head trauma inflicted on him by an adult\" consistent with being \"vigorously shaken and his head banged repeatedly against a hard surface\". Arthur's frail and skeletal body was covered with 130 bruises and he suffered 93 different areas of injury - including on his head, arms, legs, feet and torso. Even if just half of the 130 bruises on Arthur's body were the result of abuse, it would still be a mark for every day he spent being \"terrorised\" during lockdown. The injuries were so severe they were likened to those seen in a high-speed car crash. Chillingly, Arthur's final months on earth were captured in harrowing audio clips and recordings made by Tustin and Hughes. Arthur could be heard wailing in one 23-second recording \"no one loves me\" and \"no one is going to feed me\". Video footage also showed Arthur hours before he died waking up on the living room floor. The emaciated youngster was said to be so frail he could barely pick up his bedding. A serious case review has now been launched following the \"terrible tragedy\", Solihull Council confirmed.", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16934282/evil-dad-stepmum-ice-cream-arthur/": "Shocking CCTV footage obtained exclusively by The Sun shows the smiling couple relaxing on a sofa with the ices on a sweltering hot day. Arthur, six, was standing outside in the corridor, roasting in a fluffy onesie. His dad had bought the cones from a passing van and walked past him holding them before the couple tucked in. In other chilling footage, Tustin is seen scoffing two boxes of McDonald‚Äôs by herself in the front room, while hungry, rake-thin Arthur goes without food. The jury was shown hours of heartbreaking footage which also revealed how Arthur was forced to make his bed on the hard living room floor after all fell silent. On the day of his death, the camera captured Tustin suddenly waking him by grabbing his duvet and ripping it off. In his sentencing comments Mr Justice Mark Wall QC said the couple‚Äôs behaviour towards the boy was often ‚Äúspiteful‚Äù and at times ‚Äúsadistic‚Äù. He said the images from the couple‚Äôs own security cameras ‚Äúwill live with anyone who attended this trial for a very long time.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúThey are but examples of how you relished in making him suffer.‚Äù The youngster was segregated for 14 hours a day and forced to sleep on the floor in a brutal struggle that matched the ‚Äúmedical definition of child torture‚Äù. He was also poisoned with so much salt he was too weak to even put up a fight against his torturers' horrific abuse. It comes as... \"Wicked\" Tustin was convicted of murder after repeatedly smashing Arthur's head against a hard surface at the house of horrors in Shirley, West Mids. The shameless stepmum was too cowardly to even face Arthur's family and refused to enter the dock as she was jailed for life with a minimum of 29 years. Arthur's \"pitiless\" dad Hughes was caged for 21 years after being found guilty of manslaughter. Jailing the pair, Mr Justice Mark Wall QC said the case was \"without doubt one of the most distressing and disturbing\" he has ever dealt with. He said: \"This cruel and inhuman treatment of Arthur was a deliberate decision by you to brush off his cries for help as naughtiness.\" Addressing Tustin, he continued: \"You are a manipulative woman who will tell any lie, and shift the blame onto anyone, to save your own skin.\" The judge said she did not want to be \"troubled\" by Arthur any more and branded Hughes' encouragement as \"chilling\". The court was told Tustin terminated a pregnancy after she was charged with Arthur's murder. She also attempted suicide twice during the trial and has been bullied in prison. Arthur's gran Joanne Hughes, who flagged his injuries to social services in the week before his death, slammed Tustin for her \"complete lack of remorse\". In a powerful victim impact statement, she said: \"At no time have I heard evidence of her asking about Arthur or his condition - only her complete disdain and inconvenience of ¬†the situation. ‚ÄúHowever, I noted several times that she thought it appropriate to bring to the attention of others Arthur‚Äôs behaviour to justify her actions. ‚ÄúThe only pity she has shown is for herself, and ¬†not once has she apologised for Arthur‚Äôs passing while in her sole care. ‚ÄúIt is clear from Miss Tustin‚Äôs evidence we as a family will not have a definite answer or explanation as to how Arthur died. Yet another burden¬†we will have to shoulder for our lifetime.\" Ms Hughes also said her grandson was \"failed\" by the authorities before his death. She added: ‚ÄúAs a mother and grandmother it is with profound despondency that I have failed in my sole purpose to keep my loved ones safe and ensure their life is filled only with love, happiness and contentment.  \"This woeful is no longer the case for any of us. And it is with a heavy heart that we have all realised this will never be the case again. \"We as a family are emphatic that Arthur would be alive today, a happy, contented, thriving, seven year old, with the opportunity to reach his full potential during his lifetime, if Tom had not met Emma Tustin. We believe this now and forevermore.‚Äù His mum Olivia Labinjo-Halcrow, who is in jail for killing her boyfriend, also submitted an emotional statement where she described her final conversation with Arthur. She told how he was \"the most excited\" she had ever heard him as he would be seeing her soon and wanted to know how many packets of Drumstick Squashies she had for him. The mum added: \"How has losing my only child Arthur affected my life? It's impossible to put into words what losing Arhur has done to me.  \"It hasn't affected my life, it has destroyed my life. Arthur alone was my life, my purpose and reason for living.\" Labinjo-Halcrow also said is \"heartbroken\" at the thought of her boy's body lying in a \"cold box\" as he has not had a funeral yet. The youngster's family wept yesterday as the evil couple were also found guilty of multiple counts of child cruelty after six-and-a-half hours of jury deliberation. Arthur's frail and skeletal body was covered with 130 bruises and he suffered 93 different areas of injury - including on his head, arms, legs, feet and torso. Even if just half of the 130 bruises on Arthur's body were the result of abuse, it would still be a mark for every day he spent being \"terrorised\" during lockdown. Chillingly, his final months on earth were captured in harrowing audio clips and recordings made by Tustin and Hughes. Arthur could be heard wailing in one 23-second recording \"no one loves me\" and \"no one is going to feed me\". Video footage also showed Arthur hours before he died waking up on the living room floor. The emaciated youngster was said to be so frail he could barely pick up his bedding. During a lengthy trial, jurors were told how Arthur was once \"cherished by all\" while living with his dad in an annexe in the garden of his paternal grandparents. He had been placed in his dad's care after his mum was jailed for 18 years for stabbing her boyfriend to death. But his \"stable\" life began to spiral when Hughes embarked on a relationship with Tustin. Due to the national lockdown last year, the couple moved into Tustin's home in Shirley with Arthur - sparking a tsunami of abuse that ended in the boy's life cruelly being snuffed out. The once happy youngster became withdrawn and told harrowing stories of how Tustin would shove him down the stairs or call him disgusting names. He also began displaying angry, deep bruises on his emaciated body. His concerned gran Joanne Hughes called social services and offered to send them pictures of the bruising but they \"didn't want to see them\". Shockingly, child services raised \"no concerns\" when they eventually saw the abused boy and the police took no further action. Just two months later in June last year, Arthur suffered an \"unsurvivable brain injury\". During his last few months, Tustin recorded more than 22 pictures and videos of Arthur in distress. Jurors were forced to watch clips of the mum cruelly tucking into a McDonald's while Arthur was left in a hallway for 14 hours without food. They also had to listen to shocking audio of the youngster sobbing: \"Daddy's going to throw me out the window, daddy's going to throw me out the window, daddy's going to throw me out of the window.\" While Tustin's two children were lavished with affection and treated to takeaways and ice cream, Arthur was left alone in the hallway with no food or water. He was deprived of a bed and forced to sleep on the living room floor with just a duvet despite there being plenty of beds in the house. The youngster even became too weak to even hold a glass of water to his chapped lips. In his closing speech, prosecutor Jonas Hankin QC said Tustin and Hughes carried out a \"systematic course of conduct designed to terrorise, degrade, neglect and harm Arthur physically and psychologically\". He added: \"Together they denigrated and debased him, they dehumanised him.\" His dad would apply pressure to his neck using techniques learned from watching videos about police brutality in America. He also cruelly tricked his son by pretending he was going to visit his grandparents - a place \"he had felt safe\" - but never made the journey. Hughes also ripped up his beloved Birmingham City football shirt and made him wear a sweltering onesie for days during a heatwave. Horrified witnesses told how Hughes was¬†\"rough\" and \"aggressive\" towards Arthur and demanded he call him \"sir\". He also threatened to \"rip\" his six-year-old son's head off and \"use it as a football\" the day before he was killed. Meanwhile, Arthur had grown so weak he was unable to walk up stairs and his shaking legs could barely hold the weight of his own body. In vile text exchanges read to jurors, Hughes told Tustin to dig his son's grave and \"gag him with rope and a sock\". He also threatened to \"take his c*****g jaw off his shoulders\". Tustin meanwhile brander her stepson \"Satan\" and \"Hitler\" over hundreds of disgusting messages. On the day Arthur collapsed, his dad had messaged: \"Just end him...put him outside, put him out with the rubbish.\" Hughes was out shopping on June 16 last year in Sainsbury's for a birthday cake for Tustin when his son was attacked. The evil stepmum beat Arthur to death then waited 13 minutes to call 999 and tell them the youngster was \"barely breathing\" after he \"headbutted the floor\". As the stricken boy lay dying, she took a photo of his lifeless body in the hallway and texted the \"balloon lady\" about her birthday. Paramedics arrived at the home to find Arthur \"lying on his back, completely lifeless, quite pale with purple lips\". Dramatic bodycam footage showed Tustin's crocodile tears as she spoke to officers outside her home. The shameless mum blamed the youngster for his own injuries - claiming he \"headbutted the floor on all fours\". Tustin added: \"He banged his head three or four times. Obviously then I just picked him up. \"He knocked himself unconscious. I picked him up, put him on the sofa, poured water in his mouth.\" Arthur was rushed to hospital but tragically couldn't be saved and died the next day. A cause of death was given as a \"head trauma inflicted on him by an adult\" consistent with being \"vigorously shaken and his head banged repeatedly against a hard surface\". The injuries were so severe they were likened to those seen ins a high-speed car crash. Doctors found he had more than six spoons worth of salt in his system - the highest level a medic had ever seen. The amount was so substantial, the hospital at first believed their machinery was broken. As well as suffering 93 areas of injury, Arthur also had 25 sites of bruising on his scalp, face, and neck that raised ‚Äúserious concerns about non-accidental injury‚Äù. The youngster was also found to have 20 areas of bruising on his arms and eight on his chest and stomach. Giving evidence, Dr Lyle told jurors: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure that outside of obvious traumatic situations I‚Äôve ever seen a child found dead at home with this number of injuries to the head and face.‚Äù When quizzed by cops, Hughes admitted he had \"turned into a monster\" and gone \"too far\" in hurting his son. He also asked a doctor to \"apologise to Arthur on his behalf to tell him that he was sorry\" when told nothing could be done to save the boy. Hughes told police how he should have treated his son \"like a child rather than a prisoner\" and revealed how Arthur said: \"I'm in danger with you\". The dad said: \"I looked back during the last few days and did start to think this is going too far.\" But during his evidence, he turned on Tustin and the evil pair blamed each other for the abuse Arthur suffered. Hughes said he only took the blame for his partner in police interviews because she was pregnant at the time. After she terminated their baby in custody, Hughes turned on tustin - claiming she was \"gaslighting\" him and used Arthur like a \"rag doll\". Tustin even went so far as to blame Arthur for his own death - claiming he \"headbutted\" a table and \"knocked himself out\". But jurors saw through their lies and they were both convicted today of a string of offences. A serious case review has now been launched following the \"terrible tragedy\", Solihull Council confirmed. It can also be revealed Tustin was already known to children‚Äôs services over previous concerns of domestic violence. And the mum had a police reprimand for battery when she was aged 14 as well as a caution for shoplifting when aged 16. Boris Johnson's spokesman said today: \"The Prime Minister found the details of this case deeply disturbing. His thoughts are with those who loved Arthur.  \"No child should ever suffer in the way that he did. And it's clear there are questions that need to be answered to get to the bottom of how this happened.\" Tustin was also convicted of two counts of child cruelty, including salt-poisoning and withholding food and drink from Arthur. Partway through the trial, she admitted two other cruelty counts - wilfully assaulting Arthur on three occasions and isolating him. Hughes was also convicted of the cruelty offences which Tustin had admitted - but was cleared of withholding food and drink, or of poisoning his own son with salt. \"I write this on behalf of my family and with their authority. \"Arthur was the sunlight in all our lives, bringing joy, laughter and love to all of us. His death has turned the colour in our lives into a perpetual grey. Whilst our cherished and much loved 11-year-old granddaughter brings us joy and laughter, there is always the reminder that there should be double the joy, laughter and happiness, with the additional reminder that, as our granddaughter grows and blossoms into a young lady, Arthur is always missing in physical form, but never forgotten and remains constantly in our thoughts with the knowledge that any special moments in our lives will be forever tainted with forlorn contemplations. \"Throughout this trial I have heard of Arthur‚Äôs challenging and disruptive behaviour. We, as a family, want it recorded that the Arthur we knew was the model of a happy, joyous, exuberant and loving six-year-old and we will always remember him so. He bought laughter and happiness to those who loved him and he reflected that love and joy back to those who treasured him. \"Arthur‚Äôs death has had a devastating impact on all our lives, not least my 11-year-old granddaughter who, when told of Arthur‚Äôs death had her innocent view of the world shattered and now knows the stark and harsh reality of life, despite my eldest son and his partner striving avidly to avoid this so early in her life. \"My two younger sons, who are young men were, until Arthur‚Äôs devastating death, embarking on their own life journey, have now stood still in life, with thoughts or dreams of having their own children ripped from them as they are struggling to see a life containing joy and peace. \"They now have to carry with them a lifetime of anguish that no person should have to bear. I have also noted the complete lack of remorse, concern and sympathy shown by Miss Tustin throughout this trial. At no time have I heard evidence of her asking about Arthur and/or his condition, only her complete disdain and inconvenience of the situation, however I note several times she thought it appropriate to bring to the attention of others Arthur‚Äôs behaviour as if to justify her actions. \"The only pity she has shown is for herself and never once has she apologised for Arthur‚Äôs passing whilst in her sole care. I have also listened to barbed comments by a witness that the death of Arthur did not affect him, which is sickening and abhorrent. It is clear from Miss Tustin‚Äôs evidence we, as a family will not have a definite answer or explanation of how Arthur died, yet another burden we will shoulder for our lifetime. \"It is also clear from the evidence that I have heard that Arthur was failed by the very authorities that we, as a society, are led to believe are there to ensure the safety of everyone. As a mother and grandmother it is with a profound despondency that I have failed in my sole purpose to keep my loved ones safe and ensure their life is filled with only joy, happiness and contentment. \"This, woefully, is no longer the case for any of us and it is with a heavy heart that we have all realised this will never ever be the case again. \"Finally, we as a family, are emphatic that Arthur would be alive today, a happy, contented, thriving, seven-year-old with the opportunity to reach his full potential during his lifetime, if Tom had not met Emma Tustin. \"We believe this now and for evermore.\" Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?

The youngster was poisoned, starved and battered in an evil torture campaign carried out by her and Arthur's dad Thomas Hughes, 29. Neighbours at Tustin's house of horrors in Shirley, West Mids, have now claimed she would draw men in so she could manipulate them. One told Coventry Live: \"She was a nutcase, a fruit loop. \"One day, her ex came down the road, there had been a row, and she was chasing him down the road with a garden spade.‚Äù Another revealed there was a row between Tustin and a local after she moved in.

The Sun revealed over the weekend that the storm had left the set at Gwrych Castle \"looking like a warzone\", leaving bosses braced for more delays. The celebrities were first evacuated from their campsite within the castle walls and forced to sheek shelter within the great hall of the building for safety.  The campmates were then moved to a secure location - whilst still remaining in their filming bubble - while production was safely re-established.  It saw the cameras cut on the filming schedule for the entirety of last weekend, with fans missing out on two days worth of the action.  Now, they are calling for the ITV show to be extended in order to make up for the missed time - with some vying for WEEKS of extra episodes.  \"Surely they must extend now this is getting ridiculous 3 live shows cancelled no vote, at this rate it will be I'm A Celeb from a hotel,\" one fan wrote to Twitter.  \"They better extend the f***ing series,\" a second chimed in, as a third wrote: \"OK but you better extend the series and let Richard back in.\" \"Can they please extend this series till new years eve,\" someone else tweeted.  It comes after ITV made the announcement that the much-loved show WON'T be extended despite the missed episodes last week.  Reps for the show have now said that the series will still end on the same date as originally planned, and they won't be making up for lost time. After three shows were cancelled, ITV announced this afternoon that¬†I'm A Celeb¬†would be back on our screens on Tuesday night. But it didn't stop some viewers from suggesting that the series should be cancelled due to extremely cold conditions.

This is not sustainable. \"Patients are being affected and so are staff. The¬†NHS¬†in south Devon just broke.

The hospital staff are facing huge pressures with reports of people waiting for up to 13 hours in A&E. Staff are also reeling after being told their Christmas parties have been cancelled by bosses due to concerns over the new Omicron variant, according to Devon Live. Ian Currie, medical director at Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‚ÄúLike many hospitals across the country, we have been under sustained pressure in our emergency department for several months now. ‚ÄúCurrently extreme pressure is impacting on our ability to admit patients in a timely way which means that ambulances are currently waiting to discharge patients and we are not able to see people as quickly as we would like.  \"We would like to offer our sincere apologies to everyone who is waiting for treatment.

All patients arriving at our emergency departments are triaged and assessed with the most clinically urgent being prioritised.  \"This does mean that anyone presenting with less urgent needs is likely to face a very long wait for treatment.\" It comes after Royal Cornwall Hospital declared a critical incident in October after 25 ambulances were left queuing outside amid \"unprecedented\" demand. The county's main hospital was breaking point as 100 patients flooded the emergency department - that only has the capacity for 40. Staff had been forced to work \"extraordinarily hard\" to try and cope with the demand that the Trust says has been exacerbated by the number of patients attending the hospital, who should be receiving care elsewhere. The hospital escalated its operating level to an \"internal critical incident\" amid the influx of patients and the queue of ambulances waiting to offload. Ambulance crews shared images of the huge number of emergency vehicles mounting up outside of the A&E department at the hospital. South Western Ambulance Service said 30 per cent of their ambulances had been left waiting outside of various hospitals waiting to offload poorly patients. In September, three hospitals in the county were forced to suspend all urgent and planned surgeries¬†after a colossal surge in Covid patients. They made the \"difficult decision\" after mounting pressure on NHS services, while the 999 operators were answering calls every 25 seconds. And one NHS trust were¬†forced to call in the military due to staff shortages¬†as they buckled under the pressure from the¬†pandemic.  ", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16832888/dr-li-meng-yan-chinese-defector-covid-poisoned-2/": "In an exclusive interview with The Sun Online, Dr Li-Meng Yan told how she fled to the US after she was warned about a plot to have her \"disappeared\" - but not before she was became very unwell after eating a pair of spiked fried eggs.  The 38-year-old, who studied at a military medical school, was working at the World Health Organisation's lab in the city when she asked to conduct a \"secret\" investigation into the new \"SARS-like\" virus emerging in Wuhan in late 2019. She used her extensive network across hospitals and labs to find out more from military doctors and researchers about the mysterious \"Wuhan flu\" ravaging China.  And she soon uncovered bombshell evidence suggesting Covid might not have natural origins - and believed the virus could have been \"conveniently created\" within a lab over a period of just six months. Scientists continue to debate the origins of the virus - and many have slammed Dr Yan's view as a conspiracy theory. But the defector sticks by her allegations and says she has been interviewed by US intelligence. And it is now a mainstream line of investigation as to whether Covid could have leaked from a lab in Wuhan rather than having natural origins.  Dr Yan's findings were publicly broadcast across China in January last year - revealing to the world for the first time that Covid was a terrifying threat to the entire world.  But Beijing silenced her after she tried to raise the alarm about a potential cover up of the origins of the pandemic. Dr Yan was called a \"liar\" and urged to \"keep silent and be careful\" - and in a chilling warning, she was told she would be \"disappeared\".  On April 28 last year, Dr Yan fled to the United States to \"warn the world\" about China's plans to weaponise coronaviruses.   But just two days before she left Hong Kong, Dr Yan told The Sun Online suddenly became unwell.  Dr Yan claimed the Chinese Communist Party tried to poison her to stop her exposing the government's alleged cover up of the pandemic.  She said she became very ill after eating two fried eggs for breakfast - with her doctor telling her she had been poisoned.  \"Two days before I left Hong Kong, I became very sick, so I knew something was wrong,\" Dr Yan told The Sun Online.  She managed to get out to see a doctor the day after the breakfast when she started to fell unwell.  \"The day after eating the egg, the doctor said my heart had a problem,\" she said. \"I had a resting heart rate of 130. The doctor was shocked - my heart had been very healthy before.\" \"I believe the Chinese Communist Party tried to [poison me] after finding out I would be going to the US,\" Dr Yan said. She managed to escape to the US, where she was met by multiple government agencies at the airport.  However, she fears the Chinese agents have followed her to the US and are still trying to stop her - including attempts to torpedo her first TV appearance.  Dr Yan has continued to receive threats to her life on US soil. She said she was once told she would be \"kidnapped and would wake up in Hong Kong\".  And her passport was also exposed by Communist Party agents, she claimed.  During her early investigations into the origins of pandemic, Dr Yan noted the stark similarities between the Chinese military's bioweapons programme and the events surrounding the Covid outbreak.  She said the People's Liberation Army's official bioweapons textbook from 2015, which is in the public domain, is the lens through which the pandemic should be investigated.  Dr Yan said a database of complex viruses was being formed by the military, with the end goal of creating a variety of pathogens which could be unleashed on the world as \"unrestricted\" bioweapons.  According to the document, Dr Yan says, the tweaks to the viruses would be specially designed to appear as if they had emerged from nature, rather than a lab.  Another military textbook, published in 2014, outlined the Chinese military's plans to use aerosols and insects to spread viruses, and to attack livestock and agriculture in order to wipe out food supplies, Dr Yan said.  She claimed the Covid pandemic is an attack by the Chinese Communist Party on the world as part of its plan to achieve global dominance by 2035.   \"China is a terrorist. It will never admit the origins of Covid, but we should not wait,\" she said. \"Leaving more time will allow China to develop more bioweapons. We need to realise the nature of the Chinese government now.\" Despite repeated threats, Dr Yan has vowed to continue her fight to tell the world about China's bioweapons programme - and she warned the Covid outbreak is \"just the beginning\".  \"Covid was almost successful but I revealed their strategies, so people are now gathering evidence,\" she said. \"The Chinese government has enjoyed the Covid pandemic and it's now working on its next five-year plan.\" Although Dr Yan has been criticised by some, she said she has spoken to the FBI \"many times\" and claimed the intelligence officials believe she is \"very credible\".  And Dr Yan insisted she didn't receive any \"special help\" from US lawmakers upon her arrival in the country - but some states do offer her a police escort when she visits.   Despite repeated threats, Dr Yan said she will continue her fight to tell the world about China's bioweapons programme - and the origins of the pandemic.  The brave virologist has vowed to \"keep fighting until the last minute\" of her life to uncover the truth. \"If I don't do this, I would be regretful. I'm lucky and I'm still alive. I'm cautious and I get help from good people,\" she said. \"If it happened, it happens. If it doesn't, I'll keep fighting. I will fight until the last minute of my life. Even if I died, my evidence is still there.\" China has furiously denied any allegations,¬†but top former intelligence bosses said the evidence of a lab \"accident\" is clear to see - and there has been a calculated cover up \"from day one\".

Children under the age of five are not yet able to have the coronavirus vaccine. However, she and her partner lost their newborn son, Tyler Rendon Jr, to the coronavirus in February. Ms Rendon told KCRA3, a Sacramento TV network: \"I don‚Äôt know how many times a doctor has told me ‚Äòdon‚Äôt worry, your baby won‚Äôt be affected by Covid‚Äô but he was, unfortunately. \"Be careful who touches your baby. It can just start with a little kiss from somebody you know who was exposed and not shown symptoms.\" Husband Tyler Rendon added: \"We took heartbreak in our family because of Covid - we lost an infant to something we had no control over. \"Our doctor said [our son] was healthy. Coronavirus didn‚Äôt build his system, it destroyed his system.\" The couple said they now keep their son‚Äôs ashes in a cabinet and wanted to make sure other parents were aware of the risks to their kids. Since the start of the pandemic, some 6.9million kids have tested positive for Covid up to November 25, 2021, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Covid cases among US children are above 100,000 for the sixteenth week in a row, comprising 17 per cent of the country's total cases. The official advice is still that children are not as susceptible to the most severe side effects of the disease but the AAP says that more research is needed on the impact of Covid on minors. It states: \"It appears that severe illness due to Covid-19 is uncommon among children. \"However, there is an urgent need to collect more data on longer-term impacts of the pandemic on children, including ways the virus may harm the long-term physical health of infected children, as well as its emotional and mental health effects.\" Do you have a story for The US Sun team?

But now, after months of misery, there is hope on Tyneside once more.¬† Howe and the players did a lap of honour after the game, with the 52,000 Geordies lapping up every second.¬† Confidence is what this team needed, and confidence is what they‚Äôve now got.¬† Leicester away next week all of a sudden looks winnable, and survival all of a sudden looks more than achievable for the Saudi Arabia-owned Mags.¬† Howe made two changes after drawing with with Norwich on Wednesday, with skipper Jamaal Lascelles and Miguel Almiron in for the suspended Ciaran Clark and Ryan Fraser.¬† Burnley had a day less to prepare after their goalless draw with Wolves on Wednesday, but had James Tarkowski and Jack Cork back from suspension to replace Ben Mee and Ashley Westwood.¬† The Clarets were unbeaten in five but winless on the road in eight.¬† But for all Sean Dyche‚Äôs warriors controlled the opening half, Toon went into the break 1-0 up via Wilson‚Äôs expert strike after 41 minutes. This match was never going to be easy on the eye - and so it proved. Tight and scrappy, it‚Äôs the sort of game Dyche probably goes to bed hoping to dream about.¬† Burnley didn‚Äôt create a host of great chances during the opening 45 - until injury-time - but always looked in control.¬† Maxwel Cornet had the first opportunity but flashed wide on his right peg.¬† Johann Gudmondsson then rattled the near post after his shot from the left of the box deflected off Javier Manquillo.¬† Toon were sloppy on the ball and lacked any fluency.¬† But in Allan Saint-Maximin they have a player capable of producing a moment of magic from anywhere, and his dinked ball to Wilson almost had them in - only for Charlie Taylor to recover with a heroic block.¬† Wilson was not to be undone in the 40th minute though.¬† Joe Willock‚Äôs floaty cross from the left should have been meat and drink for Nick Pope.¬† But after plucking the ball, the England stopper dropped it as he fell into Fabian Schar.¬† Wilson gathered it and took a couple of touches to his right to create some space and fired over the covering Chris Wood into the roof of the net.¬† Burnley really should have been level at the break though, only for sub Matej Vydra - on for the injured Cornet - to snatch at it and lash well over having been played in by Matt Lowton.¬† The Magpies had a decent chance to double their lead minutes after the break after Wilson‚Äôs through ball to Miguel Almiron, but the Paraguayan‚Äôs low effort whistled just wide.¬† As the second-half went on, St James‚Äô grew louder and louder as that first win grew closer and closer.¬† Far from clinging on at first, Toon had Burnley under the cosh.¬† Almiron arrowed one straight for the top corner and it looked like it was going to send the Gallowgate into delirium, only for sub Connor Roberts to head it over at the last second.¬† Moments later and Jonjo Shelvey let fly from 20 yards, with Pope doing well to tip it over.¬† Burnley were always going to have a chance to ruin the party brewing though, and it arrived with six minutes to go.¬† They worked it to Ashley Westwood on the left, who played it in low across the six-yard box.¬† Sub Jay Rodriguez got in ahead of Lascelles and poked it home, leading to a moment of deathly silence.¬† But as the Burnley subs poured onto the pitch in celebration, the linesman‚Äôs flag went up - with replays showing the Clarets striker half a yard offside.¬† Then¬†it really was nerve-shredding stuff for the Geordie faithful.¬† Balls were being lumped in from here, there and everywhere, with Newcastle holding on for dear life.¬†And hold on they did, for what could be the result that sparks them into life and up the table.  ‚öΩ Read our Football news live blog for the very latest rumours, gossip and done deals ", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/16938484/bt-sport-apologise-zola-swears-west-ham-chelsea/": "The Italian icon was a guest pundit for the West Londoners' visit to West Ham - who he used to manage - and he turned the air blue just minutes into the show.

The fake report led to several calls into the manager of the 60-year-old who is due to appear in Sheffield on Saturday night for an event with fans. Much to the relief of Frank‚Äôs supporters, he took to social media to reassure them he was safe and well. In a Twitter post shared Saturday morning he said: ‚ÄúMorning, I was bemused to see this yesterday suggesting I had died!‚Äù He later said: ‚ÄúChill. I‚Äôm alive and well and writing my Christmas cards and working tonight and looking forward to meeting my fans in Sheffield.‚Äù Last month Bruno told the Sun how he was celebrating hitting the landmark 60th birthday. In it he revealed he regards Tyson Fury as the most inspirational sports star on the planet. He told how the Gypsy King was now following in his own legendary footsteps - both in and out of the ring. In an exclusive interview to mark turning 60, Frank said Fury has taken on the mantle of being Britain's best heavyweight boxer, but deserves even more credit for his work championing mental health awareness in troubled youngsters. And Frank told how his friendship with the Gypsy King was even helping him to win his own battle with mental health problems after years of trying to overcome his demons. Frank told The Sun: \"I've seen a lot over my 60 years but witnessing the way Tyson has turned his life around may well top the lot. \"Nobody has done more in the past few years to raise awareness of mental health problems than Tyson. \"He's the most inspirational sports star on the planet in my book. \"We've both had difficult days but it has made us great friends and I am now seeing first-hand how Tyson is truly on a mission, inside and outside of the ring, to help others. \"Tyson has told me he even wants to try and find a cure for mental health problems one day so others don't go through what we have. \"And I'd back him to do it. I'd trust Tyson more than most of the politicians around these days.\" In 1995, the year before he quit the ring, Bruno defeated Oliver McCall at Wembley to win the WBC Heavyweight Championship, which is still ranked among British sport's greatest moments. As well as a glittering career which saw him win 40 out of 45 fights, he has also become a national treasure for his career on stage and screen. A poll in 1996, the year he retired, ranked him the second most popular Briton, behind Princess Diana. But five years after retiring, Bruno was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and his life unravelled. The illness has since seen him sectioned - detained as a psychiatric hospital inpatient - four times, most recently last summer.  Now he is planning to open a string of mental health centres to help those who have gone through similar struggles. Frank said: \"The last 12 months have been probably the hardest in my life.  \"Last summer I couldn't have put my hand on my heart and said I'd have been out of hospital to celebrate my birthday. \"I thought I had things under control but Covid and lockdown just pulled the rug from under my feet. \"I struggled to cope with being locked down and losing friends from Covid.

One said: ‚ÄúKadeena openly speaking about living with MS on national tv & raising awareness of it is so inspiring, no doubt she will help and reassure others living with the condition.‚Äù Another posted a ‚Äòcrying‚Äô emoji and added: ‚ÄúKadeena opens up to confidently about living with MS. Wow what an inspirational figure. We love you Kadeena, keep being brilliant.‚Äù A third also shared the same emoji while writing: ‚ÄúVery brave of Kadeena to openly speak about her MS battle! You are very inspiring Such a horrible condition to have to deal with.‚Äù I'm A Celebrity fans were left chuckling tonight after two massive blunders forced Ant and Dec into redoing their intro. The Geordie duo¬†burst through the doors of Gwrych Castle in Wales to welcome viewers to the show when Dec's jacket buttons suddenly burst open. Dec said: \"Hello, good evening, ooh I've just popped open my buttons!\" A split-second later,¬†Ant¬†crashed into a tall candleabra and brushed his arm against a naked flame. Thankfully, his jacket did not catch alight but he exclaimed: \"Oh no! I've hit a candle!\" Dec¬†quickly asked the¬†I'm A Celeb¬†crew: \"Can we start again? Can we start again?\" I‚Äôm A Celebrity fans all had the same complaint after the stars won two mini eggs EACH after Arlene Phillips and Simon Gregson took part in the latest Castle Coin challenge. Viewers of the ITV show were in shock at how little the campmates were given after they won the sweet treats fair and square. But many fans took to Twitter to point out how unfair the number of eggs they got each. One wrote: ‚Äú2 mini eggs? Absolutely ridiculous I‚Äôd rather not eat any as I‚Äôd just crave more.‚Äù A second said: ‚Äú2 only 2 mimi eggs ‚Äì your so mean #ImACeleb.‚Äù A third questioned: ‚ÄúHalf a miniegg each?‚Äù The Emmerdale star shared a heart-to-heart with David Ginola tonight. Danny broke down in tears and admitted he was feeling homesick. The soap star praised David for comforting and supporting him. The actor said the I'm a Celeb experience was an \"emotional rollercoaster\" and like nothing he'd ever experienced before in his life. I'M A Celebrity star Danny Miller's pal was behind the plane prank that saw a supportive message flown high above Gwrych Castle. The Sun can exclusively reveal that the banner backing Danny to win was the brainchild of Love Island's Scott Thomas. It was inspired by a similar stunt carried out by PrettyLittleThing boss Umar Kamani for his¬†pal, and Scott's brother, Ryan Thomas¬†when he was in the Celebrity Big Brother house. A source said: \"Scott loves a stunt and is always game for a laugh. He wanted to to lift Danny's spirits and let him know how well he's doing and how much everyone loves him. It was all good harmless fun.\" The show's production crew were thrown into a panic after spotting the huge banner that said \"Danny Miller to win\". Kadeena Cox opens up about crippling multiple sclerosis Having an honest chat with Arlene, the former Strictly judge asked Kadeena about her multiple sclerosis condition. The Paralympian star explained that her multiple sclerosis is triggered by fatigue and she usually goes to bed to help ease the symptoms. She said that when she gets emotional she has more spasms, weakness, loss of control in arms and legs and she can struggle with her speech. Kadeena said she is a \"part-time wheelchair user\" and uses her wheelchair when she is out. But she also added that she \"hates sympathy\" and can often get judged. The show has faced numerous setbacks - with ITV axing it over the weekend after extreme weather conditions during Storm Arwen caused production difficulties at Gwrych Castle in North Wales. Saturday, Sunday and Monday's live episodes were cancelled, and the show returned on Tuesday - but not without fears it could be cancelled again if the bad weather returns. Bosses are facing the prospect they will again have to remove the stars from the Grade II-listed building after the Met Office warned Storm Barra was brewing.

I gave up on this run, however, way back in August, when ITV announced they weren‚Äôt returning to Australia. That should also have been the moment, of course, the network told their accountants to get lost and mothballed the show until they could provide Ant & Dec with the backdrop their performance actually deserves.

Just last week viewers branded the¬†programme \"a joke\"¬†after the BBC Breakfast presenter landed himself a spot in tomorrow's show. They were left scratching their heads over how the 44-year-old¬†escaped a spot in the bottom two yet again -¬†claiming that he is being \"overmarked\". After Thursday evening's installment of It Takes Two, fans are convinced that it's going to happen again. One viewer wrote on¬†Reddit: \"I watched It takes two..... Dan is doing better with tango than rumba last week.... And AJ seems to struggle with salsa.... If voting is still as strong as ever.... Aj might be in bottom 2...\" A second said: \"I think by now a lot of people have their favourites, like AJ, and will vote for them even if they have a bad dance. But of course if she does happen to find herself in the dance off anyway and she's struggling with the Salsa then the judges might not be able to save her even if they wanted to.

Former Wales manager¬†Gary, who played for Leeds and Newcastle, killed himself after suffering with crippling mental health issues. A source said: ‚ÄúDan was in bits because he had watched a re-run of his interview with Gary which took place the day before he died. The two were very close, and it was a haunting, harrowing watch. Dan tried to hold it together, but the emotion of the evening became too much after their dance and he broke down in the dressing room. ‚ÄúNadiya¬†consoled him. She was amazing, and basically let him cry it out on her shoulder. As a result people have been gossiping backstage about Dan and Nadiya‚Äôs closeness, but it was entirely innocent. ‚ÄúShe has been his rock ‚Äî not just this week, but every week, as he‚Äôs been landed with criticism simply for staying in the show.

Appearing on Good Morning Britain, she said: \"It is more of a hostage situation possibly. But I do think that is something that is not focused on - the friendships that can be made through Strictly. We absolutely adore her. For us it is not a Strictly curse. We have actually gained a new member.\" Speaking about Dowden's recovery, she said: \"She is good. She was sat on the sofa last night. The colour is back in her cheeks. She has still got her hot water bottle and every now and then you can see she is in pain. People with Crohn's are living with pain. But it is nice to see the pink going back into her cheeks.\" \"The Great British Bake Off winner said he sends people who troll him the contact details for the Samaritans, a charity helpline for those struggling with isolation, mental health issues or suicidal thoughts. \"I often find that people who have the need or the urgency to say something very hurtful and personal directly to somebody, they often are suffering themselves,\" he said. \"And so they get personal back and try and retaliate with a clever witticism. \"I just say, 'here's a number for the Samaritans and I hope you find the peace that you're looking for'.\" Whaite has teamed up with American Express to create a festive Shop Small Sandwich recipe especially for small businesses. The campaign aims to support small businesses by encouraging the nation to shop small throughout the festive season and beyond. Strictly Come Dancing star John Whaite has praised fellow contestant Tilly Ramsay for being a \"role model\" after she was eliminated from the dance competition over the weekend. The TV baker topped the leaderboard on Saturday with a dazzling Argentine tango, while Ramsay missed out on a place in the quarter-final after she faced CBBC presenter Rhys Stephenson in the dance-off. Whaite, 32, also revealed that he deals with social media trolls by sending them the number to the Samaritans helpline, as he finds people who send hurtful messages are often suffering themselves. He told the PA news agency: \"I think Tilly is a remarkable young woman, I said it on social media and I said it to her. \"I think the way she's conducted herself with grace, integrity, decorum over this entire thing. She's a role model to young men and women everywhere because she had some knocks with being in the dance-off but she pulled herself back up and dusted herself off and she cracked on.\" Here‚Äôs who has left the show so far: Strictly viewers have picked up on Nikita and Tilly‚Äôs strong connection, and even¬†accused them of ‚Äúflirting‚Äù in past TV appearances.

The finale will then be available for viewers wishing to catch up with the programme on¬†BBC iPlayer. While the competition has accustomed viewers to separate results shows on Sunday, the final result is expected to be revealed on the Saturday night. Strictly Come Dancing star John Whaite was forced to rest after being left in ‚Äòso much pain‚Äô. The 32-year-old and Johannes Radebe are currently in training for the BBC dance contest‚Äôs quarter-finals. The dancing pair made it through on Sunday night after getting a near-perfect score for their Argentine tango. But on Tuesday, John had to leave rehearsals early, telling his Instagram followers he was off to rest. He took a snap of himself in the back of a car, and said: ‚ÄúGoing home to rest. My hip flexors are in so much pain and the physio has recommended a day of rest. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll watch Christmas films all day and eat Haribo.‚Äù Tilly Ramsay and Nikita Kuzmin were the latest duo to be booted from the show. They appeared on It Takes Two where host Rylan Clark probed Nikita about the judges scoring. ‚ÄúSome of the judges‚Äô comments; there were a few things about feet, a few things about arms,‚Äù he started. ‚ÄúDo you think, Nikita, that justified the lower scoring?‚Äù But when Nikita hesitated to be critical, Rylan shouted: ‚ÄúCome on! You‚Äôre out now! You can say what you wanna say, come on.‚Äù Tilly giggled as Nikita decided to still respond with diplomacy. ‚ÄúI agree with this absolutely because samba is the most difficult dance,‚Äù Nikita explained. ‚ÄúSamba is a difficult dance. You have different body rhythms to do your steps with, you have different actions. ‚ÄúYou have feet actions, you have arms ‚Äì you have some many things you have to do.‚Äù ‚ÄúAt the same you have to be sassy, you have to do all the beautiful shimmy things that Tilly did. ‚ÄúSo unfortunately, yeah I agree.‚Äù John Whaite will dance the samba, as Rhys Stephenson takes on the Argentine Tango.

London Underground bosses rejected calls from the RMT to hire dedicated Night Tube drivers to fill in the shifts during discussions this week. They say the resumption of the Night Tube only means drivers will have to work four night shifts a year making a minimal impact on their work / life balance. But the RMT Union said it's ‚Äúbecome clear the drive from tube bosses is all about cutting costs regardless of the impact on staff and the services they operate‚Äù. TfL said there was potential for ‚Äúlittle or no service‚Äù on the Victoria and Central lines for the next three weekends. Read our Tube Strike live blog for the latest news and updates... Here are alternative ways to travel around London during the Tube strike: Buses and roads are expected to be busier than usual and travellers are advised to allow more time for their journeys and to walk or cycle where possible. Some boroughs offer electric scooters to rent, which is the only way to legally ride one in London. These areas are Camden, City of London, Ealing, Hammersmith and Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth, Richmond upon Thames, Southwark, Tower Hamlets and Westminster. Renting an e-scooter typically costs between ¬£3.25 and ¬£3.40 for a 15-minute journey, according to TfL. Christmas shoppers will struggle to commute with the strikes set to take place every weekend up until the big day. Further action has been planned each weekend in the run-up to Christmas on the Central and Victoria lines. There will also be another five -line 24-hour shutdown on the final Saturday before Christmas. TfL have called for RMT to call off the strike and enter talks about the staffing requirements of the Night Tube. Thousands signed a petition in the wake of¬†Sarah Everard‚Äôs¬†kidnap, rape and murder by twisted Met cop Wayne Couzens, for the night tube to resume. Many want the tube service to come back to create a safer way of travelling around London at night. Commuters should check before they leave for their commute to see whether the lines are heavily affected. Those travelling will be able to use the Official TFL website to check for closures and disruption. Normal off-peak fairs apply across the service with day travelcards valid until 4.29am the day after purchase. There¬†is also staff on hand at all stations while the service is in operation to assist passengers. Additionally TfL has said there¬†is ‚Äúan enhanced policing presence during the overnight services‚Äù, as more than 100 cops have been¬†deployed to patrol the 144 stations that will stay open through the night each weekend. City Hall believes the Night Tube provides a boost of over ¬£70million a year to London‚Äôs economy, as well as supporting approximately 2,000 jobs. Nick Dent, director of London Underground customer operations, said the strike by RMT was ‚Äúavoidable‚Äù and it might have serious consequences as it comes ahead of Christmas. Nick said the strike: ‚Äúwill threaten London‚Äôs recovery from the pandemic, despite no job losses and more flexibility and job certainty for drivers‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhile every other union has agreed to these changes and our staff have been enjoying the benefits of the changes since August, we‚Äôre willing to work with the RMT and review the changes after Night Tube services have returned,‚Äù he added. The Tube strikes kicked off at 4am on Friday 26 November after a 24 hour walk out was organised. The plan is that overnight action from 8.30pm to 4.30am each Friday and Saturday will continue every weekend until the run up to Christmas. The strike action is due to continue in the same vein over the next weekend and until December 18. There will also be another five-line 24-hour shutdown on the final Saturday before Christmas. TfL has called for RMT to call off the strike and enter talks about the staffing requirements of the Night Tube. According to the¬†Transport for London¬†(TfL) conditions of carriage it is prohibited to carry opened containers of alcohol and to drink alcohol on TfL services. Clause 2.6 of the TfL Conditions of Carriage says: ‚ÄúOn our buses, trams and trains, in our bus and rail stations and on tram platforms, you must not: consume alcohol [or] be in possession of an open container of alcohol.‚Äù Famous rule breakers include the MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington,¬†Diane Abbott, who was pictured in April 2019¬†swigging a ¬£2 Marks & Spencer mojito¬†on an overground train in North London. On another occasion, a¬†drunk man with no shoes or trousers¬†was spotted sleeping whilst standing up on a London Tube. Alcohol was banned on the¬†London Underground¬†on June 1, 2008, in one of¬†Boris Johnson‚Äòs first policy statements after he became Mayor of London. Further action has been planned each weekend in the run-up to Christmas on the Central and Victoria lines. There will also be another five -line 24-hour shutdown on the final Saturday before Christmas. All train operator and instructor operators working on the Central and Victoria lines are instructed not to book on for any duty commencing: between 20:30 on 3/12/21 and 04:29 on 4/12/21between 20:30 on 4/12/21 and 04:29 on 5/12/21between 20:30 on 10/12/21 and 04:29 on 11/12/21between 20:30 on 11/12/21 and 04:29 on 12/12/21between 20:30 on 17/12/21 and 04:29 on 18/12/21 The Night Tube was ditched in March 2020 so more trains could run during the day to increase social distancing at the height of the Covid pandemic. Transport for London said no drivers have been forced to switch to part or full-time work if they do not want to. A statement said: ‚ÄúSince August when the changes came in, more than a quarter of our female Night Tube operators remain part-time, six remain on night shifts only and 11 have moved to part-time day shifts, which they couldn‚Äôt do before grade consolidation. ‚ÄúThe figure for men remaining part-time is 16%, with eight remaining on night shifts and 16 moving to part-time day shifts. ‚ÄúThis shows the appetite for full-time work from drivers previously on Night Tube contracts.‚Äù A MASK row broke out between commuters on a train after one passenger refused to let others sit on a seat next to her. Three women were locked in a brawl after one passenger, wearing a black hat and pink coat, refused to move her bag to let anyone else sit down on the Tube. At one point during the bizarre altercation, a third woman forced her way into the seat despite the pushing and kicking from the pink-coat lady. She then jumped up shouting about how she was exempt from wearing a mask ‚Äì with the blonde woman responding: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm exempt as well.‚Äù The row started when the second woman, wearing a black coat, tried to sit on the Tube seat. But the seated passenger said: ‚ÄúWhat is wrong with you? Did you just come out of cave?‚Äù The standing passenger wearing a black coat argued back saying: ‚ÄúOut of a cave?Are you actually going to put your hands on me over a seat on a train that I have paid for today?‚Äù The union claims Transport for London has \"ripped up\" an agreement on drivers being allowed to choose whether to work on night services. Further strikes are planned in the run-up to Christmas. TfL said drivers will only work four nights a year, adding that new rosters have been agreed by other unions. The strikes are set to resume again this evening. It will be the second night in a row that a walkout has been staged during the night tube service on the Victoria and Central Lines. The disruption will last until early Sunday morning. What does TfL say about the strikes? A statement on the TfL website reads: \"This weekend's planned strike action is part of a further four nights and one full day of disruption ahead of Christmas, which will impact Londoners and the city's recovery at a crucial time.  \"The RMT has taken this action over new rosters, which have been agreed by the other recognised union and were introduced for Tube drivers in August.  \"This strike action has been called despite the new rosters including assurances that there will be no job cuts, providing certainty and the option of permanent work for those on part-time contracts and only scheduling four night shift weekends per year - shifts which can be swapped with colleagues for duties at other times of day if that works better for them. \"Talks between TfL and RMT are ongoing as TfL seeks to try and avoid this unnecessary action.\" The¬†first lines to take on the 24-hour service were the¬†Central and Victoria lines on August 19, 2016. Central line services run between Ealing Broadway and Loughton/Hainault while the entire Victoria line stays¬†open. Services were then¬†launched on the Northern¬†line¬†and the Piccadilly line joined the network. And in July, 2017, it was announced the London Overground, also referred to as the Orange Line, will operate all night on Friday and Saturdays between New Cross Gate and Dalston Junction ‚Äì with the service to then be extended to Highbury & Islington in 2018. The Northern line ran a 24-hour from Morden via Camden Town and on to Edgeware/High Barnet with no service on the Bank or Mill Hill East branches. Piccadilly line ran between Cockfosters and Heathrow Terminal 5 with no services on the Terminal 4 loop or between Uxbridge and Acton Town. The night tube is the metro in London that runs throughout the night on certain days and lines. Former Mayor Boris Johnson‚Äôs brain child was held back by¬†a year as the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union (RMT) clashed with TfL over pay and conditions. But the project¬†took off in 2016¬†and after a staggered start all five proposed lines are running all-night services for Londoners¬†on¬†the weekends with the London Overground now set to join them. Commuters should check before they leave for their commute to see whether the lines are heavily affected. Those travelling will be able to use the Official TFL website to check for closures and disruption. Nick Dent, director of London Underground customer operations, added: ‚ÄúThe RMT‚Äôs planned strike action is needless and it will threaten London‚Äôs recovery from the pandemic, despite no job losses and more flexibility and job certainty for drivers. ‚ÄúWhile every other union has agreed to these changes and our staff have been enjoying the benefits of the changes since August, we‚Äôre willing to work with the RMT and review the changes after Night Tube services have returned. ‚ÄúThis review can only be successful if the RMT agrees to meet us for talks and withdraws its proposed action so we can all see how these changes will work in practice. ‚ÄúIf the RMT refuses to engage with us and carries out its unnecessary action, which is timed to cause maximum disruption for our customers looking to enjoy London during the festive season, Londoners are advised to check before they travel on days of planned strike action.‚Äù The Night Tube was ditched in March 2020 so more trains could run during the day to increase social distancing at the height of the Covid pandemic. Thousands signed a petition in the wake of¬†Sarah Everard‚Äôs¬†kidnap, rape and murder by twisted Met cop Wayne Couzens, for the night tube to resume. Many want the tube service to come back to create a safer way of travelling around London at night. The ongoing dispute is over the night shifts that drivers will be required to work to enable the¬†restart of the Night Tube. Since the start of the pandemic it has been suspended, but was due to resume overnight on Saturday for the first time. The RMT claim that the workloads being forced on Tube drivers would wreck their work-life balance by ‚Äúbulldozing through additional night and weekend working‚Äù. General Secretary Mick Lynch said: \"We are angry and disappointed that the tube management have refused to move forward based on genuine and realistic proposals that could have enabled us to recommend the suspension of the planned action. As a result the strike tomorrow goes ahead \" The issue at the heart of the dispute is that the dedicated Night Tube driver grade, which was popular with women and those with caring responsibilities, an‚Äéd which the union fought to get written in to the original Night Tube agreement, has been ripped up with complete disregard for the staff themselves. \"We have made every effort in ACAS and direct talks since the off to resolve this dispute but it is increasingly clear that LU bosses are driven solely by the bottom line and appear to have no interest whatsoever in the well being of their staff or the service to passengers. ‚ÄúThe union remains available for further talks even at this late stage and it's time for the Mayor to stop siding with the management against the union and start using his offices to push for a resolution. ‚Äú", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/uknews/16936460/amber-gibson-death-brother-court-murder-2/": "Connor Gibson, 19, was also accused of sexual assault and attempting to pervert the course of justice by prosecutors. The short private hearing at Hamilton Sheriff Court came five days after his sibling, 16, was found dead in the woodland near the town‚Äôs Cazdow Glen. Gibson, also of Hamilton, was remanded in custody after making no plea.He is due back in the dock again next week. The charges follow a major probe into Amber‚Äôs disappearance and alleged murder. We told how she vanished last Friday after leaving her home in the town's Hillhouse. The last confirmed sighting of Amber was in Cadzow Street, near a bridge, just before 10pm on Friday, 40 minutes after she left her home nearby. But she never returned and the alarm was raised in the early hours of Saturday morning. Her body was discovered shortly after 10am on Sunday around 200 yards away from where she was last seen. It emerged yesterday Gibson had paid tribute to his sister just hours before he was arrested ‚Äî saying: \"I love you.\" He also also shared an online appeal for locals to \"leave a light on\" in memory of Amber. Gibson was brought to court amid tight security with police closing nearby roads. Gibson‚Äôs court appearance came as devastated relatives told of their grief at their loss.

And he said his sick feeling quickly turned to panic when he woke up and realised his phone and wallet were missing - checking his account to find it had been drained in just a few hours. Speaking to the BBC, the young man said: \"I woke up pretty dizzy, dazed and not quite sure what happened so obviously I was a bit alarmed. \"I had messages from my brother saying: 'Is everything OK [because] there's been an overdraft opened up on our joint account. What's happened?' \"As soon as I saw that alarm bells started ringing.\" It is believed the thieves used banking apps on Ben's smartphone to transfer and withdraw thousands of pounds. Two ¬£2,500 overdrafts were created on his accounts and his savings were transferred to his current account and then withdrawn.  The total amount stolen from his American Express, Revolut, HSBC and Monzo accounts was more than ¬£18,000. Spiking drinks is usually associated with men targeting woman and with sexual assault as a motive, with a string of women reporting fears they had been injected with unknown substances on nights out. But Ben believes he was targeted by criminals who wanted to defraud and steal from him.  Ben said: \"I feel terrible, absolutely terrible. Over the next few days I couldn't stop thinking about it, couldn't sleep, I found it very hard to eat. Because ultimately I felt worried and vulnerable.\" Cops are investigating Ben's case as part of a linked series of 16 fraud offences targeting male clubbers in Clapham.  A 36-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of fraud on September 23, but later released. And a 39-year-old man was then arrested on November 17 on suspicion of fraud and taxi touting. The man was bailed and is set to return to the station in mid-December. The investigation continues.  Inspector Dave Laurie, London Metropolitan Police said: \"Spiking is a terrible thing that's happening and it goes further than the impact on the individual. The impact will run deep. And we know many spiking incidents will go unreported.\" Inspector Laurie said victims shy away from reporting similar incidents because of embarrassment and memory loss.  He added: \"Buy your own drink, watch it being poured, don't accept drinks from strangers and never leave it unattended. If your drink doesn't taste right, throw it away.\" David Clarke, chair of the Fraud Advisory Panel charity, said people need to be alert to \"sinister tactics\" used by fraudsters and the dangers of spiking this Christmas party season.  He said: \"Fraudsters are cruel, devious people online and in the physical world and  people must be alert to the danger of having drinks spiked.\" It's hard to know how common spiking fraud is. Clarke added: \"We need big tech and big finance to come up with big solutions to this type of fraud. \"Yes individuals can try help themselves, but there is a limit to what people can do.  \"We need technology to help because the crooks are so advanced.\" Monzo and American Express refunded Ben's stolen cash within days. HSBC and Revolut initially refused the refund, but reversed that decision once Money Box started investigating the case. HSBC said: \"We have thoroughly reviewed this case, and in light of new information we will be providing a full refund to Mr Gregory. \"While we have an experienced team looking for signs of fraud, as this case sadly highlights, scammers are unscrupulous criminals who use a range of techniques to exploit their victims. We encourage people to be on their guard.\" Revolut said: \"This was an unusual case where the payments were authorised by the customer but, as is now clear, without his consent. We very much regret the distress and inconvenience to Mr Gregory and we have reimbursed his losses.\" This comes as several UK police forces are investigating a spate of spiking incidents by injection.

The TikTok user's most recent post informs its 1.2million followers of two important dates to remember for December 2021.  According to the \"time traveler,\" the dates to be aware of are December 20 and December 25. The post reads: \"December 20th - 8 Humans receive super powers from the energy waves of the sun. \"December 25th (Christmas Day) - Something big will happen on this day that shocks the world, and changes the way humans live forever.\" The \"time traveler\" explained in a previous Tik Tok post that the \"big day is remembered for centuries, and changes how humans live.\" \"This will 100% prove that I am a real time traveler, don't forget the date,\" ThatOneTimeTraveler adds. Additionally, the \"time traveler\" claims that the countries known as Sweden, Norway, the United Kingdom, and Finland will \"unite together\" in 2027 ‚Äî \"creating a massive powerhouse.\" The Tiktoker says the \"massive powerhouse\" would inspire smaller countries to want to join. \"Other countries like this idea and this starts a big spark in uniting big nations together,\" ThatOneTimeTraveler explains. And in 2024, as per the dates notes by the \"time traveler,\" a 35,000-year-old bunker will be \"discovered.\" The bunker, which will be supposedly be located in Argentina \"has many secrets inside of it, such as ancient times, technology, hidden code, and more.\" Another interesting date to remember is August 20, 2022. ThatOneTimeTraveler says: \"The sky across all of Earth will become a bright green color. \"The reason the sky turns green is because a planet not too far from Earth explodes that is full of green rocks. \"The green sky lasts for around 5 hours then slowly fades away.\" The TikToker also claims that in 2022 the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers will defeat the Brooklyn Nets in game 7.  Meanwhile, a man who believes he's a time traveler from 2030 claims he has X-ray \"proof\" of a device implanted in his hand that he insists helps him jump dimensions for \"secret missions.\" The self-styled time traveler, who calls himself Noah, says the gadget was inserted before he \"went back in time\" and claims to be stuck in the \"wrong year.\" And a Tik Tok \"time traveler\" who says they‚Äôre from 2714 has predicted when a human fish species and the alternative universe will be found. The out-of-this-world prophecy sees things taking a strange turn on Earth in just days. The wild predictions come from the @aesthetictimewarper¬†account also known as \"a real¬†time-traveler‚Äù. The time traveler believes that three teens will open a portal to an alternate universe using a T. Rex dinosaur egg in December 2021.

Another 75 cases of Omicron have been confirmed in England, taking the total for England to 104 and for the UK as a whole to 134 - including the first confirmed case in Wales. And more than half of the Omicron cases in England are among Brits who are double vaccinated, health officials have revealed.  SAGE and subgroup Nervtag have called for the introduction of vaccine passports and work from home guidance to curb the spread of the variant. According to a note released by the government advisory group last night, the scientists concluded the variant would be able to set off a new wave of infections. \"We cannot exclude that this wave would be of a magnitude similar, or even larger, than previous waves,\" they said. \"It is important to be prepared for a potentially very significant wave of infections with associated hospitalisations now, ahead of data being available.\"  They added: \"A large wave of infections will be accompanied by a wave of severe cases and the subgroup cannot rule out that this may be sufficient to overwhelm NHS capacity.\" SAGE said remote working and the return of face coverings in all indoor public settings remained a \"highly relevant\" way of countering the spread of the variant.¬† Working from home is part of the government‚Äôs¬†‚ÄúPlan B‚Äù - which also includes vaccine passports. Neither have been implemented to control the¬†virus, but face masks became mandatory from Tuesday in response to¬†Omicron. The government advisors warned the situation \"could develop quickly over the coming weeks\" and said ministers \"may need to act while there is still a high level of uncertainty\".   People have been told to work from home where possible in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But Boris Johnson has rejected suggestions to reimpose the rules in England - which ended on Freedom Day earlier this year after Brits worked from home for months. Professor Adam Finn, a member of the government‚Äôs Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, has recommended Brits return to working from home. \"The more people can work from home now the better, until we are more definite about what‚Äôs going to happen,\" Prof Finn told¬†The Guardian. The University of Bristol expert added: \"We need to buy time. If in three weeks it‚Äôs died out, then fine, we can all relax, but right now is the time when you could prevent there being a big wave.\" But on Monday the Prime Minister's spokesman said it was up to employers to decide on the ‚Äúright balance‚Äù for them, when it came to whether staff worked from home or the office. SAGE said there is currently insufficient data to make any conclusions on the severity of disease associated with the new variant. But the minutes of the meeting, held on Monday, said it is highly likely Omicron can escape immunity to some extent - but it is not yet clear how much. The scientists warned: \"Even if there continues to be good protection against severe disease for individuals from vaccination (including boosters), any significant reduction in protection against infection could still result in a very large wave of infections. \"This would in turn lead to potentially high numbers of hospitalisations even with protection against severe disease being less affected. \"The size of this wave remains highly uncertain but may be of a scale that requires very stringent response measures to avoid unsustainable pressure on the NHS. \"If vaccine efficacy is substantially reduced, then a wave of severe disease should be expected.\" It comes after a risk assessment by the UK Health Security Agency rated Omicron as \"red\" for severity of infection and \"amber\" for transmissibility. Government advisors have already warned Covid could ruin Christmas celebrations for the \"next five years\" until it settles in an endemic state. But Mr Johnson said¬†Christmas parties should continue¬†to go ahead - after comments from top expert Dr Jenny Harries that Brits should start to¬†cut their social contacts. In government papers, experts said caution should be taken during festive gatherings and that the R rate could reach 1.4 by the end of December. The government has extended its booster campaign to¬†18-39 year-olds¬†in order to get on the front foot of Omicron infections and to give Brits as much protection as possible. Brits aged 40 and over, or those who have serious health conditions can book their vaccines through the national booking service, while people 18 and over will have to wait for the NHS to call them forward for their jabs. ¬†", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16939810/russian-intercept-us-plane-black-sea-ukraine/": "Fears of war are growing in the region as US intelligence revealed they believe Vladimir Putin is preparing for a massive offensive against Ukraine. Washington believes that Moscow is massing some 175,000 men along with a large arsenal of tanks and artillery to prepare for an attack on Kiev.  Western observers have been nervously watching the rumbling of Russian troops and armour near the former Soviet state over the past few months.  Russia has denied any aggressive intent towards Ukraine - but has also laid down red lines about its neighbour's relationship with NATO. And in the latest flashpoint, Su-27 and Su-30 fighter jets saw off an American RC-135¬† reconnaissance aircraft¬†over the Black Sea. Black Sea waters and airpsace regularly patrolled by Western militaries and their Russian counterparts, often leading to tensions. And the landlocked sea is believed to be a key tactical point for a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine. Meanwhile, pictures also show Russian military drills underway in regions close to Ukraine, including Voronezh and Belgorod. A report said: \"Servicemen of the (Vistula) division's tank and motorized rifle units, as well as logistics specialists, were the first to begin the field exercises.‚Äù The drills ‚Äúwill soon be joined by the liaison, air defence, radiation, chemical and biological defence units and military engineers.‚Äù Sniper drills involving 700-plus military shooters¬†are underway in four regions in striking distance of Ukraine. And separately Moscow warned Western navies to stay out of Arctic waters close to Russia, accusing NATO of ‚Äúprovocative‚Äù activity in a vast region where Kremlin war games are now underway.¬† Russia has long been feared to have ambitions to seize back parts of Ukraine, which broke away with the Soviet Union collapsed in the 90s. Putin illegally annexed Crimea from the country in 2014 - a move that plunged the region into Chaos. Moscow always claims it was merely liberating people who wanted to be part of Russia.  And meanwhile a civil war has also been raging in Eastern Ukraine ever since, which sees Kiev pitted against pro-Russian rebels who allegedly receive material support from the Kremlin. The Russian plans call for a military offensive against Ukraine as soon as early 2022 US intelligence reportedly fears Russia is preparing for a \"massive offensive\" against Ukraine in a move that would test the West's resolve. Kiev's allies have always pledged to support them, but intervening against Russia could risk spiraling into a conflict that could explode into World War 3.  Russia has been demanding Ukraine will not join NATO and raging the US must stop all military activity in the region. ‚ÄúThe Russian plans call for a military offensive against Ukraine as soon as early 2022 with a scale of forces twice what we saw this past spring during Russia‚Äôs snap exercise near Ukraine‚Äôs borders,\" a US official told The Washington Post. ‚ÄúThe plans involve extensive movement of 100 battalion tactical groups with an estimated 175,000 personnel, along with armor, artillery and equipment.‚Äù The unclassified document obtained by The Post, shows Russian forces have been deployed in four locations- there are currently 50 battlefield tactical groups tanks and artillery. The US map shows approximately 70,000 troops near the border but it predicts the number is set to rise to 175,000. According to the official the analysis is partly based on satellite images that ‚Äúshow newly arrived units at various locations along the Ukrainian border over the last month.‚Äù Additionally, the document states that ‚Äúequipment may be left behind at different training ranges to enable a rapid, final buildup.‚Äù Kyiv‚Äôs¬†defence minister Oleksiy Reznikov said intelligence indicated a possible¬†Russian¬†invasion in late January.¬† And¬†Ukrainian¬†commander Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Kyiv's defence intelligence agency, said Russia could invade Ukraine by the end of January with an attack¬†involving some 100,000 soldiers. Russia¬†has previously warned war is \"highly likely\"¬†saying that Kiev's desire to retake Crimea is a \"direct threat\" to them. Putin has also ordered US officials to leave¬†Russia - further stoking tensions. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Putin could quickly order an invasion of Ukraine if he had a pretext for doing so. He said America was \"deeply concerned by evidence that Russia has made plans for significant aggressive moves against Ukraine‚Äù. \"We don't know whether President Putin has made the decision to invade. We do know he's putting in place the capacity to do so in short order,\" he said. Russia has also \"intensified disinformation to paint Ukraine as the aggressor\" and increased anti-Ukrainian propaganda by more than tenfold to levels not seen since its 2014 invasion of the country. \"The idea that Ukraine represents a threat to Russia would be a bad joke if things weren't so serious,\" he said. He said Putin may \"claim provocation for something that they were planning to do all along.‚Äù RUSSIA and the Ukraine have remained technically at war since 2014. since 2014. Ukraine was aligned with Russia as part of the Soviet Union until its collapse in 1991, following which it became an independent state. Both nations remained closely tied - but Ukraine gradually began to distance itself, seeking deeper ties with the West. The open conflict was triggered by the Ukrainian Revolution in 2014 - when an uprising overthrew the pro-Russian government of Viktor Yanukovych. Vladimir Putin's forces reacted by annexing the region of Crimea from Ukraine - a move which was widely condemned by the West. The conflict then spiralled when pro-Russian groups in Eastern Ukraine then took up arms against the state. Russia gave their backing the separatist forces which formed breakaway republics in Donetsk and Luhansk. Putin's forces then launched a military incursion into these regions as they gave their support to the rebels. Russia continues to hold Crimea - and claims the region joined them willingly after they a referendum. Seven years have now passed and the War in Donbass remains at a stalemate. It is estimated some 14,000 have been killed in the conflict, including more than 3,0o0 civilians. Ukraine and the rebels signed a new ceasefire in July 2020 - but clashes have been steadily increasing again throughout 2021. Russian troops have also been detected moving around the borders of Ukraine - stoking fears that 2022 could be the year of an invasion.

But occasionally throughout a woman's lifetime, she may notice something smells a little off down there, which could warrant a trip to a medic.¬† It could be something metallic, rotten or fishy. Dr Ayanthi Gunasekera, a Specialist Registrar in gynaecology at London Gynaecology says the most important thing to remember is that vaginas have a natural odour and each woman‚Äôs odour is different and can change temporarily. The vagina changes smell as a woman goes through her menstrual cycle, which is why you may notice it smells more or less from one day to the next. Regardless of what you can smell, don‚Äôt attempt to clean it.¬† The amazing thing about the vagina is it is self-cleaning. It produces fluids that keep the natural balance of bacteria just right. Dr Gunasekera said: ‚ÄúBy trying to mask the smell or ‚Äòclean‚Äô the vagina with soaps and perfumed washes (including perfumed sanitary towels) you can disturb the natural balance that can lead to further changes, becoming a vicious cycle that is sometimes difficult to get on top of. ‚ÄúUse only water to wash, dry well, wear cotton underwear and let your vagina ‚Äòbreathe‚Äô by avoiding wearing tight clothing all the time.‚Äù Dr Gunasekera also revealed the smells that are probably worth taking notice of: If you notice a pungent fish smell, it is probably bacterial vaginosis (BV).

This may happen if you have sex with a new partner, use an IUD for contraception or spray perfume in your knickers (never advised!). The discharge if you have BV tends to be frothy, grey or green. However, around half of women with BV do not have symptoms.¬† But fear not, BV can be treated with a course of antibiotics. Sometimes, if you have a partner, it‚Äôs best to treat them too. The other cause of a fishy smell is trichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted infection (STI).¬† ‚ÄúTrich‚Äù is also characterised by itchiness and pain when going for a wee. Ever smelt a beer-like odour from down there?This, or a sweet yeast-like smell, is likely due to thrush, Dr Gunasekera said. However, there is not always a smell.¬† Thrush tends to cause ‚Äúwhite curd-like discharge like cottage cheese‚Äù, she added. But when most women think of thrush, they know it for its symptoms of intense itching that can leave the vulva dry and red raw. There are medicines for thrush you can get as easy as over-the-counter in a pharmacy or supermarket. You may be offered a cream to soothe the itch or a pessary, which you insert into the vegaina using an applicator, to help clear the yeast infection. Symptoms tend to go away in one to two weeks.¬† But for some, thrush can be a reoccurring problem due to things like contraception, poorly controlled diabetes or antibiotic use.¬† A metallic smell similar to metal or coins is nothing to worry about - it‚Äôs simply due to your cycle, Dr Gunasekera said. Before and after the bleed, there might be a more metallic smell you were not expecting. There is no treatment required for it. A smell which can only be described as ‚Äúrotten or very unpleasant‚Äù would occur if you left a tampon inside too long, Dr Gunasekera said.¬† Her advice was to remove it as soon as possible. But if you are struggling to do so - which might happen if the tampon gets stuck and compressed at the top of the vagina - visit a GP or sexual health clinic where they can do it for you. A tampon should not stay inside the vagina for more than eight hours, the NHS says. An unpleasant smell, pelvic pain or high temperature is a sign you need to get it out urgently. Although we pee from down there, it doesn‚Äôt normally smell of urine. Unless, that is, someone has a urinary tract infection (UTI), Dr Gunasekera said.¬† The ‚Äúammonia‚Äù type smell is due to the infection making the pee more potent. Other symptoms include cloudy or bloody urine and a high or low temperature. Most people are familiar with UTIs causing a constant urge to urinate and pain when doing so.¬†¬† Do you have a story for The Sun news desk? Email us at exclusive@the-sun.co.uk or call 0207 782 4104.

At the same time, city buyers seeking their dream seaside property are pushing house prices up, sometimes even pricing locals out of the market. Property search Rightmove has analysed searches across its website to identify the most sought-after areas. It defined the most in-demand coastal areas as those which received the highest numbers of buyer enquiries in 2021. The most popular area was Bournemouth, where prices have risen to ¬£317,449 on average. Next most searched was Southampton, followed by Brighton, Blackpool and Poole. The study also tracked which coastal regions have seen the biggest percentage increases in searches. These up and coming areas are rising rapidly up the charts as more people consider relocating to them. Searches in Lancashire rose by 32%, making it the top coastal rising star. Next up was Blackpool, where searches rose by 21%. Three locations tied for third place, each seeing a 15% spike in searches: Great Yarmouth, Swansea and Saltburn-By-The-Sea which is in Cleveland. Unsurprisingly, all the extra demand is forcing coastal prices up, which is good news for anyone looking to sell in these regions. Padstow in Cornwall had the sharpest increase in house prices, with averages rising by 20% to ¬£658,588. Asking prices in Whitby jumped by 17% to ¬£254,218, while St Ives costs went up by 15% to ¬£473,161. The fourth highest house price increases were in Porthcawl, South Glamorgan, where averages have reached ¬£307,051. Rightmove tracked activity on its website between January 1 and November 24 2021 and compared it with the same time period in 2020. But the significant price tag jump as demand for coastal properties booms could make getting on the housing ladder more of a struggle for some people. Tim Bannister, Rightmove's director of property data said: \"In terms of average asking price growth, homeowners in Cornwall and Devon are the real winners this year, with properties in some areas outpacing the national average, though this does mean that it is increasingly difficult for some locals to get onto the ladder. \"Overall, this has been the year that either through changed lifestyle priorities, or the ability to work remotely, living in coastal areas has become possible for more buyers, which is reflected in the data we're seeing in this study.\" Here are some of our top tips for keeping costs down if you're looking to move closer to the seaside. Make low offers Don't set your heart on one property, instead make low offers on several in one area. Make sure you have your mortgage-in-principle as it could help convince sellers. Shop around for a mortgage Make sure you use a \"whole of market\" mortgage broker, rather than just going with your bank. Shopping around can save you hundreds, if not thousands of pounds in fees. Check all fees and charges Low interest rates are important when choosing a mortgage, but they're not the only factor to consider. Make sure you consider all costs including set-up fees, early repayment costs and the interest once your deal ends. Pack up yourself Paying someone to do your packing certainly cuts the stress of moving, but it can be expensive. If you pack up yourself you can save hundreds. Save on solicitors fees Some solicitors will charge you less if you're referred by your broker. Others charge less for returning customers. Check reviews, as you want to make sure your solicitor is fast and reliable, but shop around to get a good deal.

Speaking on Jonathan Ross' chat show, which airs this weekend in ITV, the Grammy-nominated singer shared his his experience at the event. He commented: \"I performed at Westminster Cathedral. [There was] a lot of tension going on at that period of time. Harry and Meghan were there. I went to sing for the Commonwealth celebrations.\" He added: \"I always talk about how music is healing and a form of therapy. I could feel it cut through. There was a part where Harry looked up, Meghan looked up, I felt it really landed in their hearts.\" Further commenting on the experience, he said: \"It felt like that was the one moment where I was able to witness that.\" Read our Meghan Markle live below for the latest news & updates.... The¬†Duke and Duchess of Cambridge¬†must adhere to a dress code when they‚Äôre out and about at informal events, too. For women, a smart day dress or trousers teamed with a blazer is deemed acceptable, while men opt for a collared shirt with chinos. Wills is often seen in the smart day trousers, but has on occasion broken the rules and worn jeans. Etiquette expert Grant Harrold, known as The Royal Butler, told the¬†BBC: ‚Äú‚ÄùMany places will not allow jeans as they are still seen as very casual wear, so it is better to play safe for both sexes. ‚ÄúBut if the duchess is outside walking the dogs for example, then jeans are fine.‚Äù Queen Victoria‚Äôs 141-year-old XXL nightdress and chemise are expected to fetch thousands of pounds at auction after they were gifted to a royal maid in the 1800s. The voluminous lace night garments were worn by Britain‚Äôs longest serving monarch after she gained weight following the death of Prince Albert. They were given to a retiring maid who served the royal family in the 1800s before being kept by automotive pioneer Hubert Noel Charles who designed the first MG car. Hubert‚Äôs niece Hilary Aston, 79, is now selling the regal nightwear, which could fetch up to ¬£11,000 when they go under the hammer on December 7. The retired former language school owner, from Oxford, said: ‚ÄúThis nightdress was given to me by my uncle and aunt before they died.‚Äù Prince William and Kate Middleton could welcome Princess Eugenie or Princess Beatrice as their neighbour in Kensington Palace, a royal historian has said. Marlene Koenig, a royal historian and expert, has suggested that either Princess Beatrice or Eugenie could be lined up as Apartment 1‚Äôs newest tenants. She told Express.co.uk last month: ‚ÄúPrincess Anne‚Äôs home is her own and it will go to her kids, it‚Äôs not a royal home. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an area next to it that Mark Phillips helped buy before the divorce, and that‚Äôs where¬†Zara and Peter¬†live and have their homes ‚Äî it‚Äôs all going to be theirs at some point. ‚ÄúBut other homes and royal residences, right now, it‚Äôs more about maintaining what they have. William Hanson claims that¬†shorts on young boys¬†are a silent British class marker and trousers are deemed ‚Äúsuburban‚Äù ‚Äì something no self-respecting royal would want to be considered. He told The Sun Online: ‚ÄúNot only does The Duchess of Cambridge have to worry about dressing herself but she has to dress her own children appropriately. ‚ÄúShe has to find a balance between royal tradition, heritage and more proletariat customs, such as the ‚Äòsuburban‚Äô habit of making young boys wear trousers.‚Äù William said the dress code harks back to historic traditions that state ‚Äúshorts are for little boys, trousers are for men‚Äù and he probably won‚Äôt wear trousers until he‚Äôs around seven or eight years old. Although he did break with tradition at his uncle‚Äôs wedding by¬†wearing trousers. The¬†Queen is rarely seen without her gloves, which are often Michael Jackson-esque white or a dark-toned leather to match her handbag. The monarch wears these for practical reasons during the daytime as she is frequently required to shake hands with hundreds of people. This fashion item helps stop germs being spread from person to person. Long opera gloves are worn for formal evening events such as state banquets. Piers tweeted Harry and Meghan ‚Äúbullied‚Äù the Queen into allowing them to leave the¬†Royal Family. He wrote on social media: ‚ÄúBREAKING: Harry/Meghan have successfully bullied the Queen into letting them have their cake & eat it.‚Äù Before the talks he branded Prince Harry a ‚Äúwhiny, entitled parody of himself‚Ä¶ bullying¬†Queen¬†into a woke monarchy.‚Äù He went on to call the couple ‚Äútwo spoiled brats‚Äù whose behaviour towards the Queen is ‚Äúutterly outrageous‚Äù, again attacking the¬†10-year veteran army captain Harry, calling him ‚Äúweak, whiny and miserable‚Äù. When the pair announced their interview with Oprah,¬†Piers‚Äô outrage only increased. In¬†Brothers And Wives: Inside The Private Lives of William Kate, Harry and Meghan, a new book about the Royals, the author, Christopher Andersen, claims that it was in fact the Queen‚Äôs actions that tipped them over the edge and finalised their decision to move to California. Apparently in 2019, prior to recording her annual festive broadcast, which airs every year on Christmas day, she instructed an assistant to move a photo of Harry and Meghan out of shot. Which exact photo it was is unknown, but it is claimed that only Meghan and Harry were in the image. It is believed the photo was on a desk alongside other framed photos of Royals including¬†William and Kate, Prince Charles and Camilla, the Queen‚Äôs father George VI, and the Duke of Edinburgh, too. Prince Charles‚Äô favourite actor Antony Sher has died at the age of 72. The legendary stage actor, best known for his work performing Shakespeare, was¬†diagnosed with terminal cancer¬†in September. The Royal Shakespeare Company announced the double Olivier Award-winning actor‚Äôs death in a¬†statement¬†on Friday. A free press is ‚Äúone of the cornerstones of any democracy‚Äù, Downing Street has said after the Mail on Sunday lost an appeal in a privacy row with the Duchess of Sussex. Meghan sued Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL), also the publisher of MailOnline, over five articles which reproduced parts of a ‚Äúpersonal and private‚Äù letter to her father, Thomas Markle, 77, in August 2018. The 40-year-old duchess won her case earlier this year when a High Court judge ruled in her favour without a full trial. ANL brought an appeal against that decision and, at a three-day hearing in November, argued the case should go to a trial on Meghan‚Äôs claims against the publisher ‚Äì including breach of privacy and copyright. But the appeal was dismissed by Court of Appeal judges in a ruling on Thursday. The publisher of the Mail on Sunday has said it is considering an appeal to the Supreme Court. The new design will join a collection of commemorative crown pieces from the Royal Mint over the years, which have celebrated the Queen‚Äôs Silver, Gold and Diamond Jubilees.

The Prince of Wales has paid tribute to Sir Antony Sher as \"a giant of the stage at the height of his genius\" following the actor's death at the age of 72. The Olivier Award-winning actor and director was diagnosed with terminal cancer earlier this year, and his death was announced by the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) on Friday. In a statement to the PA news agency, Charles said he was \"deeply saddened\" to learn of Sir Antony's passing. \"As the President of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), I had the great joy and privilege of knowing him for many years, and admired him enormously for the consummate skill and passion he brought to every role,\" the prince said. \"My most treasured memory of him was as Falstaff in a brilliant production of Greg Doran's. I feel particularly blessed to have known him, but we have all lost a giant of the stage at the height of his genius.\" It will be the first time since 1992 that a country has removed the Queen as head of state, and Prince Charles is attending an event to mark the change as his mother‚Äôs representative. The country making the big change is Barbados. ‚ÄúAs with a lot of other things, Barbados is one of the leaders of the region. When other countries see what‚Äôs happening here, and how easy it is to transition, it may lead to a domino effect where others follow suit,‚Äù said restaurant owner Zamani Moody to The Independent. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure of the impact it‚Äôll have, though, on the Commonwealth. I know with the separation of Britain from the EU, there was the thought that the Commonwealth would get stronger and a hope that the UK would pour more resources into that.‚Äù ‚ÄúDismantling the legacy of the British Empire isn‚Äôt going to happen till we have honest conversation locally on the values, systems and traditions we continue to uphold in our society,‚Äù Rene Holder-McClean-Ramirez, an LGBT+ and human rights advocate told¬†The Independent. As a member of the¬†Royal Family¬†and future King,¬†Prince George¬†has much more sophisticated taste than many of us ‚Äì and his favourite meal certainly reflects that. Speaking to¬†Femail, Aldo Zilli claimed that the future heir to the throne is a big fan of Italian food. Hearing this, you‚Äôd naturally assume the eight-year-old royal loves a pizza above all else. Right? However, Aldo insists that¬†Prince William¬†and¬†Kate Middleton‚Äòs eldest son loves nothing more than a spaghetti carbonara ‚Äì which are notoriously tricky to make. The Prince of Wales said he was \"delighted\" to formally open a new multimillion-pound development at London's Royal College of Music, during his first visit to the site since before the UK was locked down amid the coronavirus pandemic. Charles, who is president of the college, was treated to a performance on an 18th century harpsichord and viewed the world's oldest surviving keyboard dating back to the 1400s. He toured the new campus facilities, which include performance spaces, practice rooms for students, a courtyard and a cafe. The college's More Music development, funded by a ¬£40 million philanthropic campaign, has almost doubled the footprint of the site in South Kensington. Charles was fresh from his visit to Barbados this week, where he represented the UK at a ceremony that saw the island nation become a republic and end the Queen's role as head of state. Spotify bosses have given the pair‚Äôs Archewell Audio brand a ‚Äúgentle nudge‚Äù to finish the content and protect the future of the multimillion-pound deal. One source said: ‚ÄúSpotify were delighted when they signed the couple, but the lack of content has mystified them. Particularly as they seem to have no problem producing content for other platforms.‚Äù Another source said: ‚ÄúWhen Harry and Meghan signed the Spotify deal in December, they didn‚Äôt really have a full audio team behind them, there were no scripts ready and they hadn‚Äôt made podcasts before. ‚ÄúThe holiday special episode was whacked together but, even though it was well received by fans, it was hard for them to pull off.‚Äù She‚Äôs one of the most famous women on the planet, but the Queen is said to only have two people that have instant access to her. Her Majesty, 95, only answers her phone every time to these two chosen individuals ‚Äì and they aren‚Äôt who you would expect. Speaking on the Royally US podcast Christina Garibaldi, royal commentator Jonathan Sacerdoti revealed: ‚ÄúApparently the Queen has two people who she speaks to the most on her phones and she also apparently has a mobile phone which is said to be Samsung packed with anti-hacker encryption by MI6 so nobody can hack into her phone. ‚ÄúBut the two people she phones the most is said to be her daughter Princess Anne and her racing manager John Warren. ‚ÄúHe is the son-in-law of the Queen‚Äôs friend, the late Earl of Carnarvon and his home was Highclere castle in Berkshire which viewers of TV may know better as Downtown Abbey. ‚ÄúSo this is apparently who can get through to the Queen from anywhere in the world if he calls she answers.‚Äù William and Kate Middleton WILL send Christmas gifts to Archie and Lilibet despite their rift with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, an expert has claimed. The¬†Duke¬†and¬†Duchess¬†of Sussex are expected to spend the festive season in California while¬†Prince William¬†and¬†Kate Middleton¬†attend¬†Christmas¬†at Sandringham with¬†The Queen. In their¬†bombshell interview¬†with¬†Oprah Winfrey¬†earlier this year, Prince Harry claimed¬†Prince Charles¬†and¬†Prince William were ‚Äútrapped‚Äù¬†within the monarchy. And the television interview ‚Äì which was¬†watched by over 17m people¬†‚Äì¬†reportedly left William ‚Äúfurious‚Äù. Speaking to¬†Ok! magazine, royal expert Katie Nicholl said the¬†Duke¬†and¬†Duchess of Cambridge¬†still want to keep their Christmas traditions going. The Duke of Cambridge has followed in the footsteps of Dolly Parton and Naomi Campbell and recorded an audio walking tour to encourage the public to get active for their mental health. William strolled around the Queen‚Äôs Sandringham estate in Norfolk, sharing personal stories and music as part of the Time To Walk series featured on the Apple watch, for the technology company‚Äôs Fitness+ subscribers. Listeners are able to immerse themselves in walks featured in the series, hearing the footsteps of the narrator and the sounds around them as they take the audience on a journey through locations important to them. During the recording, made in the spring, the duke talks about the importance of keeping mentally fit, reflects on a light-hearted moment when he was drawn out of his comfort zone, the value of listening as a way to empower others, and an experience that led him to prioritise mental health. His walk takes him from the Queen‚Äôs residence, Sandringham House, past St Mary Magdalene Church ‚Äì where the royal family attend the Christmas Day service ‚Äì and ends at his nearby home of Anmer Hall. William has also picked three of his favourite songs and explains why they are important to him. PRINCE Harry and Meghan Markle have celebrated their first Thanksgiving as a family-of-four after welcoming daughter Lilibet in June. For the second year in a row, the couple have marked the US holiday¬†at their home in exclusive Montecito, California. And the family will have spent the day together before enjoying a meal prepared by Meghan. In her¬†recent interview on The Ellen Show,¬†the duchess revealed they‚Äôll ‚Äúrelax‚Äù and make the most of time spent together. ‚ÄúI love to cook, we‚Äôll be at home and just relax and sort of settle in,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our second Thanksgiving at home in California, so it will be nice.‚Äù The couple¬†moved into their home last summer¬†during Covid lockdowns. Prince Charles will ‚Äúfollow the tradition of the monarchy‚Äù in order to spare William the ‚Äúburden of duty‚Äù for as long as possible, claims a former royal butler. Former royal butler Grant Harrold told GB news: ‚ÄúI have been asked this question many times by many friends, do I think it‚Äôs possible that Prince Charles decides to not take on the position of King and step aside to pass on Prince William.¬† ‚ÄúI actually believe we would not see that happen because Prince Charles is very traditional.‚Äù In his witness statement, Mr Knauf claimed Meghan had emailed with an electronic draft of the letter asking if anything stood out as a \"liability\". The papers read: \"She also asked a specific question regarding addressing Mr Markle as ‚ÄòDaddy‚Äô in the letter, saying ‚Äògiven I‚Äôve only ever called him daddy it may make sense to open as such (despite him being less than paternal), and in the unfortunate event that it leaked it would pull at the heartstrings.\" It came at a time when Mr Markle missed his daughter's wedding after suffering a heart attack and repeatedly spoke to the media. Mr Knauf suggested she reference her dad's health problems in the letter as it is his \"best opening for criticism and sympathy\". After Meghan and Prince Harry‚Äôs shocking departure from the Royal Family, it was not immediately clear where the two would settle with their children. For some time, they lived in Canada before escaping to¬†a mansion¬†lent to them by actor and director Tyler Perry. Perry‚Äôs next door neighbor was Adele, and the singer and the Sussexes hit it off immediately. Meghan and Prince Harry then moved on and¬†purchased their own Los Angeles¬†‚Äì but still got plenty of visits from new pal Adele. The Prince of Wales has acknowledged the ‚Äúappalling atrocity of slavery‚Äù, describing it as something ‚Äúwhich forever stains our history‚Äù, during the ceremony marking Barbados‚Äô historic transition to a republic. Charles summed up the period when the UK was one of the leading players in the transatlantic slave trade as the ‚Äúdarkest days of our past‚Äù, but looking to the future said the ‚Äúcreation of this republic offers a new beginning‚Äù.

In a letter to Government, Nphet said that higher levels of socialisation combined with the impact of Omicron could pose a ‚Äúvery real but as yet unquantifiable risk‚Äù to the management of Covid-19 over the coming weeks.

The Metropolitan Police have said they are considering complaints from Labour MPs that Boris Johnson and his No 10 staff held Christmas parties in breach of Covid regulations. Labour backbenchers Neil Coyle and Barry Gardiner have each written to Scotland Yard asking police to investigate reports that two parties were held in the run-up to last Christmas at a time when such gatherings were banned. Mr Johnson has not denied the events took place but said no rules were broken - although he has repeatedly refused to explain how that could be the case. In a statement, the Metropolitan Police said that while it did not routinely investigate \"retrospective\" breaches of the Covid regulations, it was considering the correspondence it had received. On Wednesday, the Daily Mirror reported the Prime Minister gave a speech at a packed leaving-do for a senior aide last November when the country was in the midst of the second lockdown. A further 5,622 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed in Ireland, the Department of Health has said. As of Saturday morning, there were 487 people in hospitals with the virus, with 114 patients in intensive care units. Doctors' leaders have welcomed moves to ease the workload of GPs, enabling them to focus on the Covid booster jab rollout, but warned the service remains under \"significant\" pressure. Following the decision to ramp up the vaccination programme, NHS England has told GPs other targets may be suspended and routine health checks for the over-75s and for new patients can be deferred. The move comes after the Government announced it was extending booster jabs to all adults and cutting the time between the second and third doses from six to three months amid fears about the spread of the new Omicron variant. Ministers have promised a \"national mission\" to ensure everyone who is eligible can get a booking by the end of January, but have acknowledged it represents a \"huge ask\" for the NHS. Scotland's First Minister urged people to get vaccinated as she got her Covid-19 booster vaccine but said she cannot guarantee the programme will be free of \"glitches\" such as people being turned away from appointments. Nicola Sturgeon's comments came after she received her booster and flu jags in Glasgow on Saturday as Scotland recorded 14 coronavirus-linked deaths and 1,257 new cases in 24 hours. One case of the new Omicron variant has been confirmed in that time, in NHS Grampian, taking the total people infected with the variant to 30. The Scottish Government said Public Health Scotland is \"aware of a processing issue with UK Government lab tests contributing to lower than expected cases and tests\" in the daily figures and investigations are ongoing to resolve the problem. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has 11 new variant cases, followed by NHS Lanarkshire with nine, five in NHS Forth Valley, three in NHS Highland and two in NHS Grampian. Scotland has recorded 14 coronavirus-linked deaths and 1,257 new cases in the past 24 hours, according to the latest data. One case of the new Omicron variant has been confirmed in that time, in NHS Grampian, taking the total people infected with the variant to 30. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has the most of the new variant cases at 11, followed by NHS Lanarkshire with nine, five in NHS Forth Valley, three in NHS Highland and two in NHS Grampian.

Two hippos have tested positive for COVID-19 at Antwerp Zoo in Belgium in what could be the first reported cases in the species, zoo staff said. Hippos Imani, aged 14, and 41-year-old Hermien have no symptoms apart from a runny nose, but the zoo said the pair had been put into quarantine as a precaution. \"To my knowledge, this is the first time in this species. Worldwide, this virus has been reported mainly in great apes and felines,\" said the zoo's vet, Francis Vercammen. The coronavirus is thought to have jumped from an animal to a human, and it is proved to have passed from humans to animals. ¬†Zambia has detected its first cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant in three people who tested positive for COVID-19 in the past week, the health ministry said on Saturday. The three cases are a man living in the district around the capital Lusaka who travelled abroad recently and is showing mild symptoms, a man in Chibombo District who also travelled abroad recently but is asymptomatic, and a woman in Lusaka District who had not travelled abroad recently and had mild symptoms. The Omicron variant first detected in southern Africa last month has caused global alarm, with countries imposing travel restrictions for fear it could spread quickly even among vaccinated people. Scientists are trying to establish whether Omicron - labelled a \"variant of concern\" by the World Health Organization - is more contagious or resistant to existing vaccines. Hospitality organisations have warned that the reintroduction of Covid-19 restrictions for the Christmas period is a \"hammer blow\" to the sector. A range of restrictions will be in place from December 7 to January 9, including the closure of nightclubs and strict social distancing requirements for bars and restaurants. The rules will see the hospitality sector largely revert to the situation before October 22, with a maximum of six adults per table and no multiple table bookings. It comes amid concern about increased socialising at Christmas and the threat posed by the new Omicron variant of coronavirus. Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe TD has announced targeted support for the hospitality sector modelled on the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) which operated in the earlier phases of the pandemic. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has met with the World Health Organisation's director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, describing it as \"productive\". He tweeted: \"Productive meeting with @DrTedros and his team to share our findings so far on Omicron. \"We continue to work with @WHO on our global treaty to prepare for and respond to future pandemics, and on building a global surveillance network.\" Doctors' leaders have welcomed moves to ease the workload of GPs, enabling them to focus on the Covid booster jab rollout, but warned the service remains under \"significant\" pressure.

Dr Farah Jameel, chair of the BMA's England GP committee, said reducing the amount of \"unnecessary\" appointments would create some additional capacity, but that individual practices would have to decide how much they could switch to delivering Covid jabs. Omicron cases in Scotland have jumped by 16 in the past 24 hours to 29, with a Steps concert among the sources. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned they may rise ‚Äúsignificantly‚Äù in the coming days as the variant is now circulating in the community. The update comes as Scotland recorded 16 coronavirus-linked deaths and 2,432 new cases in the past 24 hours. Previously, nine Omicron cases were linked to a single private event, but the First Minister said there are now several different sources of infections of the new variant, including a Steps concert at the Hydro in Glasgow on Monday November 22. Six cases are understood to be linked to this event, but the risk to attendees is said to be low. 2,000 Sun readers have already signed up for our brilliant Jabs Army. But¬†we need to recruit at least 25,000 steward volunteers¬†to make sure everyone gets a booster jab to protect against the new¬†Omicron variant of Covid. Match of the Day host¬†Gary Lineker, who has backed our campaign from day one, last night urged Sun readers to get involved. He said: ‚ÄúThe Jabs Army Voluntary Service needs a shot in the arm. Help boost the boosters.‚Äù The short answer is yes. If you are certain it is not¬†Covid¬†you are suffering with and you are well enough to leave home, you can get your third shot with confidence. It might make you feel a bit rougher than if you weren‚Äôt ill, but overall it‚Äôs perfectly safe ‚Äì and you can emerge from¬†your sickly funk¬†safe in the knowledge you are protected against coronavirus. A cold shouldn‚Äôt have an effect on your body‚Äôs ability to build an immune response to the flu, even though it is fighting an illness. NHS guidance says you should still attend your appointment even if you have a mild illness, including a common cold. A doctor who was one of the world‚Äôs first people to be infected with the Omicron Covid variant believes he caught it in London, it was reported. Elad Maor¬†was in the UK for a conference for three days until November 23, around the time the more virulent strain was detected by researchers in South Africa. The 45-year-old Israeli cardiologist stayed for four nights at a hotel in Islington and experienced symptoms after returning home, then tested positive on November 27. ‚ÄúI got the Omicron in London, for sure,‚Äù he told¬†The Guardian. ‚ÄúThat is interesting because that was 10 days ago in London ‚Äì really, really early.‚Äù The father-of-three explained he took a PCR test on November 20 after arriving in the UK and again the next day, in accordance with Israeli travel regulations, with both results negative. When he arrived back in¬†Tel Aviv on November 24, he had a third PCR test, which also came back negative. He said the only reasonable explanation is that he got infected on the last day of the meeting or possibly at the airport because the third PCR was too early to detect the infection. Zimbabwe has identified 50 cases of the Omicron variant, deputy health minister John Mangwiro said on Friday. It comes as the government announced it would start offering booster shots to frontline workers, the elderly and people with chronic illnesses. Most of the Omicron cases were detected at a teacher training college as well as the country's under-17 football team that was due to participate at a regional tournament, Mangwiro told reporters. \"From the outbreak that we detected from Masvingo Teachers College and the Under 17 soccer team, we took 20 samples from the college and 22 samples from the soccer team, they all tested positive for the Omicron variant,\" he said, adding that the other 8 cases were found in random samples.¬† The number of Covid-19 cases could surge to 15,000 a day after Christmas if the Omicron variant becomes dominant, health experts have warned. The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) said that the new variant could drive up cases during increased social activity over the Christmas period. In a letter to Government, Nphet said that higher levels of socialisation combined with the impact of Omicron could pose a \"very real but as yet unquantifiable risk\" to the management of Covid-19 over the coming weeks. Health officials warned Government that this presents \"serious challenges\" in the weeks ahead, adding that it is \"impossible\" to quantify the level of risk and its impact. Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan has urged the Government to close all nightclubs, and bring in restrictions that were in place during the summer. This includes returning to table service only in hospitality, a maximum of six people allowed per table, no multiple table bookings and no mingling between tables. The emergence of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus is the \"ultimate evidence\" of the danger of unequal vaccination rates around the world, the head of the Red Cross said on Friday. \"The scientific community has warned the international community on several occasions about the risks of very new variants in places where there is a very low rate of vaccinations,\" Francesco Rocca, the president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, told AFP in an interview in Moscow. The Government said as of 9am on Friday, there had been a further 50,584 lab-confirmed Covid-19 cases in the UK. The Government also said a further 143 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Friday. Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics show there have now been 170,000 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. Omicron cases in Scotland have jumped by 16 in the past 24 hours to 29, with a Steps concert among the sources. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned they may rise ‚Äúsignificantly‚Äù in the coming days as the variant is now circulating in the community.

Six cases are understood to be linked to this event, but the risk to attendees is said to be low. THERE are fears the Omicron variant is more severe in children than previous strains of the coronavirus. Hospital admissions in children under five have suprisingly surged in South Africa, where the concerning variant is now dominating, doctors say. Graphs show the youngest children are being admitted in rates second only to those who are over 60. Wassila Jassat, from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases,¬†told a news conference: \"We've seen quite a sharp increase across all age groups, particularly in the under fives,\" referring to hospitalisations. \"The incidence in those under fives is now second-highest, and second only to the incidence in those over 60.‚Äù This is a comment piece by Catherine Johnstone, Chief Executive, Royal Voluntary Service SUN readers are amazing ‚Äì they walk on water! Next week it will be one year since¬†91-year-old Margaret Keenan¬†became the first person in Britain to be given the Covid jab. That was to be the start of the biggest vaccination rollout in history. To make sure everybody in the country received a jab, the¬†Royal Voluntary Service¬†was asked to find 50,000 volunteers to help out. So we turned to The Sun for help and didn‚Äôt know what to expect. But within weeks the¬†Jabs Army¬†had passed the 50,000 target and eventually nearly 70,000 of you stepped up. The gift of your time really does make a difference. Sun readers have already given up 1.1million hours to volunteer at jab centres. 2,000 Sun readers have already signed up for our brilliant Jabs Army. But¬†we need to recruit at least 25,000 steward volunteers¬†to make sure everyone gets a booster jab to protect against the new¬†Omicron variant of Covid. Match of the Day host¬†Gary Lineker, who has backed our campaign from day one, last night urged Sun readers to get involved. He said: ‚ÄúThe Jabs Army Voluntary Service needs a shot in the arm. Help boost the boosters.‚Äù Government scientists have called for people arriving in the UK to quarantine for five days and take a pre-departure PCR test to curb the spread of Omicron. SAGE experts warned of a¬†potentially ‚Äúvery significant wave‚Äù¬†as new measures to tackle the new Covid variant were introduced. Close contacts of anyone infected with Omicron must quarantine at home for 10 days,¬†with flouters risking a ¬£10,000 fine, with the new rule also applying to anyone who's had two jabs. Mandatory face coverings have been reintroduced in shops and on public transport. And travel rules have been beefed up with anyone double jabbed arriving in the UK having to isolate until they receive a negative Covid test result within two days. Anyone who is not double jabbed can choose to pay for a second Covid test on day five to release them from a ten-day quarantine period. But in leaked minutes from an emergency meeting about Omicron, SAGE boffins say anybody who has returned to the UK should self-isolate for five days instead. A doctor who was one of the world‚Äôs first people to be infected with the Omicron Covid variant believes he caught it in London, it was reported.

Of the 50 or so mutations, 32 are in the spike gene, including what‚Äôs called the binding domain. These are most likely to change how the virus interacts with the antibodies of the immune system, and how it enters human cells. The spike protein is a vital part of the virus that allows it to latch onto cells. It is also the target of Covid vaccines that were built against the original ‚ÄúWuhan‚Äù strain of the coronavirus. Therefore, if the spike protein is drastically different, antibodies may fail to recognise Omicron. Raquel Viana, Head of Science at one of South Africa's biggest private testing labs, said she had \"a sinking feeling\" when she discovered the new strain while genetically testing positive swabs in the country. She told Reuters: \"I was quite shocked at what I was seeing. I questioned whether something had gone wrong in the process.\"", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/16932967/national-lottery-numbers-latest-lotto-uk-results-checker-euromillions/": "Tonight's National Lottery jackpot is now a rollover after no-one scooped the top prize in Wednesday's draw.

Euromillions mum¬†Gillian Bayford is locked in a family feud over her share of a ¬£148million jackpot. Gillian, 44, accused her dad Ian McCulloch, 72, of trying to seize control of the fortune she won with her ex Adrian Bayford, 46. The Dundee mum of two blasted Ian, mum Brenda and brother Colin, 42, saying: ‚ÄúIt made them bitter and greedy.‚Äù And she told how she gave them a ¬£20million slice of her fortune ‚Äî only for them to come back for more. Gillian, who runs a property firm in Dundee, said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs upsetting and it‚Äôs raw. The money was supposed to make everybody happy. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs made my close relatives demanding and greedy.‚Äù A National Lottery winning dinner lady still lives in her council house, shops in Primark and drives a Kia despite bagging ¬£1.8million. Trish Emson, 51, explained money or her¬†millionaire status¬†did not change her or her partner Graham Norton, also 51, who still works as a decorator. The down-to-earth pair have even managed to keep their teenage son Benjamin, 17, in check ‚Äì and don‚Äôt even give him pocket money. The modest mum, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, said: ‚ÄúBeing rich doesn‚Äôt make you posh or a better person. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like showing off and bragging about money and I can‚Äôt be posh anyway. ‚ÄúTo look at me you wouldn‚Äôt think I was a millionaire, but if I have to dress up I feel fake, I prefer my jeans,‚Äù she told¬†The Mirror.

By the time they saw an appeal for the winner to come forward, they couldn‚Äôt find the ticket. After 45 agonising days of deliberating, Camelot told the devastated couple that they weren‚Äôt going to receive the cash. ‚ÄúHaving that money taken away was torture,‚Äù Martyn told the Mail on Sunday. ‚ÄúFor a long time I lost sight of who I was and what I believed in.

Folks in Ireland have just half that time to claim too, with only 90 days before the prize money is off the table. Once the claim period is over, the ticket officially expires and the owner of the lottery ticket will no longer be able to claim any of their winnings. But after that time has expired, any unclaimed prizes, plus any interest they might have accumulated in that time, are allocated to the¬†National Lottery‚Äôs¬†Good Causes¬†fund instead. This will usually then go on to help fund things like sport programmes or local community buildings or other projects. Ex-jailbird¬†Lee Ryan scooped the ¬£6.5million jackpot just 17 weeks after the lottery was launched¬†on November 14 1994. He made headlines when it emerged he was accused of handling stolen cars and was imprisoned for 18 months after his huge payout. Lee then spent a decade living the high life and splashed his car on luxury cars, a helicopter and a ¬£2million mansion. But Lee ended up penniless, spent two years living on the street and shacked up in a tiny flat in London he shared with homeless pals. ‚ÄúThe money was cursed because I took the p**s out of God when I asked him to make me a multimillionaire. My cellmate warned me to be careful what I wished for,‚Äù he said. Lee ended up splitting with Karen Taylor, his girlfriend of eight years, and moved to London where he met a 25-year-old from Kyrgyzstan. They took an ill-fated trip to the Central Asian country where Lee attempted to invest the last of his winnings in property. But he returned empty-handed, claiming to have been stitched up by investors following the Kyrgyzstan revolution in 2010. Your chances to win may be remote but if you do you could win big. Here are some of the record prizes one by UK winners in the past: According to the EuroMillions website, there is a 1 in 1,900,000 chance that a player could win the Millionaire Maker game on a Tuesday. This shrinks to 1 in approximately 2,250,000 if there is a rollover ‚Äì meaning no one has won the previous draw‚Äôs jackpot. On a Friday, it‚Äôs estimated that there is a 1 in 2,950,000 chance of winning a guaranteed ¬£1million. If there is a quadruple rollover, the odds could fall to 1 in 3,400,000. Winning the game depends on the number of payslips sold so the odds fluctuate from game-to-game. The odds can also change if there is a special event. In March 2019, EuroMillions created¬†40 UK millionaires¬†in a one-off special draw. Roofer Jamie Heavens, then-22-year-old, went to work at his dad Mark‚Äôs roofing company in Dorset, near where he lives, and started his hands-on job. After being sent off to work on another site, he stopped off at Romsey Services off the M27 for fuel and also bought a scratchard. ‚ÄúI scratched it off in a layby and was stunned when it revealed I‚Äôd won ¬£1m,‚Äù he said. He kept it quiet from his colleagues ‚Äì telling only his uncle and wife-to-be.¬† However, despite winning big, Jamie said: ‚ÄúDanielle still buys me jogging bottoms from Primark. I go out and graft everyday so she knows I will get them filthy. There‚Äôs no point in her getting me really smart ones, they would just get wrecked.‚Äù Wife Danielle is still working as a receptionist at a garage whereas Jamie set up his own company, a roadside recovery service.

Let‚Äôs breakdown the unluckiest numbers: From total ticket sales of ¬£8,373.9 million in the year ending 31 March 2021: If no UK players come forward within 180 days then the prize money, plus all the interest it has generated while it is held in trust, goes to National Lottery-funded projects across the UK. The National Lottery have said: ‚ÄúOur players change the lives of individuals as well as communities by raising, on average, over ¬£33 million for National Lottery-funded projects every week.‚Äù A mum realised she had won ¬£300,000 on a National Lottery scratch card after initially believing her winnings were just ¬£1,000. Sandra Davine only discovered her huge winnings after a life-changing phone call to a lottery line operator in December last year.

The Swede scored 29 goals in 53 games and helped United win the Community Shield, League Cup and Europa League.

A probe led by Baroness Casey of Blackstock highlighted the horrific ruse among a string of ‚Äúappalling‚Äù incidents on a day of ‚Äúnational shame‚Äù at the England v Italy game. The dossier condemned the Football Association, the Metropolitan Police and local authorities over blunders which resulted in a ‚Äúperfect storm‚Äù of lawlessness. The damning report states: ‚ÄúThat it should happen at our national stadium and on the day of our biggest game of football for 55 years is a source of national shame.‚Äù Huge crowds of rowdy troublemakers had thronged the showpiece venue for hours before the 8pm kick-off on July 11, boozing wildly and openly snorting cocaine after Covid restrictions eased. And 2,000 ticketless yobs stormed through security cordons before and during the match as police and security staff lost control. Baroness Casey wrote of the wheelchair stunt: ‚ÄúIn one appalling incident, a ticketless fan tried to impersonate a steward and hijack a disabled child and separated him from his father, in order to trick his way through a pass gate.‚Äù Describing the incident, the boy‚Äôs dad told the review: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs then taken my son‚Äôs wheelchair and pushed it towards the door. ‚ÄúJust as we got to the door, we twigged what was going on and it turned out he‚Äôs just an England fan in a hi-viz jacket that was literally hijacking a wheelchair to get into the stadium.‚Äù Baroness Casey added: ‚ÄúDisturbingly, it is clear that ticketless fans targeted disabled supporters in a predatory fashion near the turnstiles.‚Äù The inquiry heard that concerns about supporters were raised by a Brent Council official who alerted colleagues, the FA, Wembley bosses and police as early as 9.02am. His WhatsApp message read: ‚ÄúTalking to fans‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äânone with tickets, just here for the occasion. Might be a big feature of the day.‚Äù By noon, 10,000 fans had arrived around Wembley hoping to cheer Harry Kane and the England stars to a historic victory. But transport staff were shocked by the drunken behaviour of some. A London Underground official said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been doing this for over a decade and have worked on various other celebratory events, including New Year‚Äôs Eve. ‚ÄúI have never seen drunkenness like this so early on in the day. \"I remember walking into the control room at about 9am and there were England fans drinking as I walked in. I have never seen drunkenness like this so early on in the day. \"The alcohol was flowing. And I thought, ‚ÄòThis is going to be a hard day‚Äô. I felt it was going to be really challenging.‚Äù A probe by The Sun had exposed two Wembley ¬≠stewards who attempted to sell their hi-viz bibs and security passes for ¬£4,500 in a worrying security lapse. The pair sauntered away from their posts at 4pm to meet a Sun investigator who tipped off police, leading to their arrest and prosecution. Mounted police charged crowds soon afterwards in a vain bid to stop ¬≠hundreds of fans storming and swarming through barriers. An official at Brent Council ‚Äî which was also criticised in the report ‚Äî said at its height, the disorder resembled a ‚Äúmedieval siege‚Äù. One witness told the review: ‚ÄúI saw bottles and cans being thrown at people, children cowering behind parents, trees being ripped up and thrown, people climbing on roofs and throwing things into crowds.‚Äù Analysis showed 17 mass breaches as yobs gained entry by ‚Äútailgating‚Äù fans with tickets or forcing their way through disabled access gates and emergency fire doors. The breaches stretched from 90 minutes before kick-off up to the penalty shoot-out at the end. All agencies responsible for ¬≠staging the final had been caught off-guard, the review found, with police deployed too late at 3pm ‚Äî when crowds were already beginning to run riot. Almost half of respondents to a fan survey detailed in the report saw drug-taking in and around the ground. That this should happen anywhere in 21st-century Britain is a source of concern. Baroness Casey said the authorities‚Äô ‚Äúcollective failure to foresee risk‚Äù turned the landmark event into a virtual war zone. She added: ‚ÄúI am clear we were close to fatalities and life-changing injuries for some, potentially many, in attendance. That this should happen anywhere in 21st-century Britain is a source of concern.‚Äù The report warned the chaos came close to causing a repeat of the 1989 Hillsborough Disaster which cost the lives of 97 Liverpool fans after a security breakdown. Baroness Casey said: ‚ÄúSome of what happened was sadly foreseeable, even if the scale of it was not. The events at Hillsborough in 1989 have weighed heavily on my mind.‚Äù She added after the report was published yesterday: ‚ÄúOur team of role models were in our first major final for 55 years. ‚ÄúHowever they were let down by a horde of ticketless, drunken and drugged-up thugs who chose to abuse innocent, vulnerable and disabled people, as well as police, volunteers and Wembley staff, creating an appalling scene of disorder. ‚ÄúWe are genuinely lucky that there was not much more serious injury or worse. ‚ÄúNo one was fully prepared for what happened that day and it can‚Äôt be allowed to happen again. Our team were let down by a horde of ticketless, drunken and drugged-up thugs who chose to abuse innocent, vulnerable and disabled people creating an appalling scene of disorder. ‚ÄúLaw-abiding fans, our national team and our national game deserve better.‚Äù FA chief executive Mark Bullingham said: ‚ÄúThe FA apologises for the terrible experience that many suffered within Wembley on what should have been a historic night for the game. ‚ÄúThe review makes clear that the circumstances leading up to the match led to a perfect storm of lawlessness. ‚ÄúNo event is set up to deal with such disgraceful behaviour from thousands of ticketless fans. ‚ÄúCollectively, we must never allow this to happen again.‚Äù The Met Police said yesterday it was ‚Äúdeeply sorry‚Äù so many people faced ‚Äúunacceptable scenes of disorder‚Äù. Commander Rachel Williams said the final was ‚Äútarnished by groups of ticketless, anti-social and thuggish football fans‚Äù. She added: ‚ÄúWe regret that we were not able to do more to prevent those scenes unfolding.‚Äù Do you have a story for The Sun news desk? Email us at exclusive@the-sun.co.uk or call 0207 782 4104.

Rodwell started in the second of the two at Wembley and was brought off in the 59th minute and replaced by - you guessed it - Sturridge. Both were making international debuts. If there is a football spirit he was at it again a few days ago when he went to work on the other side of the world in Oz. Rodwell made his debut for Sydney Western Strollers while Sturridge did likewise with Perth Glory. It might have been to the exact minute because, oddly, both came on as late substitutes. Maybe the three-hour time difference between the cities confused our little pixie because Rodwell played for 13 minutes, Sturridge for three fewer. But at least they were on their way, not as has-beens in their late golden hours, rather as players still with a good deal to offer unless, as so often as in the past, they break down with injuries: Rodwell suffers hamstrings as if they were made of cotton; Sturridge has those too but also a collection of others, including to knee, hip and thigh. \n And a gambling problem that has clouded his later years. Still, as I say, there should be plenty of eye-catching skills left in him at 32; and plenty of energy in Rodwell at 30. They started young, both as youth internationals but Rodwell‚Äôs decline began in the middle of the last decade. The first time he played for Everton he was two days short of 18. After a brief move to Manchester City during which he won a Premier League championship medal he was sold to Sunderland as a defensive player. It wasn‚Äôt too long before the Stadium of Light became for him a place of darkness, as much a rehabilitation ward as place of achievement. Two northern newspapers made it clear they thought he wasn‚Äôt worth the ¬£10m fee City received. The worst signing in Sunderland‚Äôs history, they declared. Brief stays at Blackburn and Sheffield United seemed to confirm that this powerful athlete had little else to give. He played once in the whole of last season for the Blades before fleeing from what for him was an English scrapheap, along with his Australian wife and son to the sunshine of Perth. Neither he nor Sturridge leave behind the reputation they should have although in fairness to Sturridge he certainly experienced a glory year or two, never more so than when he partnered Luis Suarez in what became known as the SAS partnership in 2013-14 when Liverpool were runners-up behind City in the Premier League. He scored 21 goals that season, carrying himself with pure menace, as sleek as a python in the penalty area. It seemed then that England had found a striker of continental style, a man who would go on to secure at least 50 caps. Instead, he gathered 26 in bits and pieces, his career winding towards its conclusion, culminating in a loan spell with West Brom and a move to Trabzonspor, twice punished for betting offences. ‚ÄúMy best years are ahead of me,‚Äù was the hopeful cliche Rodwell used at the start of his career in Sydney. Perhaps. Perhaps the Wizard of Oz will be kind to both of them.  ‚öΩ Read our Football news live blog for the very latest rumours, gossip and done deals ", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/16933847/man-utd-ronaldo-injury-palace-rangnick/": "The absence of Ronaldo would be a major early blow for Rangnick, who yesterday vowed to get the best of the 36-year-old superstar. Sources at United suggested the Portuguese talisman may have hurt his knee doing his trademark jump celebration after scoring the winning penalty in Thursday‚Äôs 3-2 win over Arsenal at Old Trafford. Yet Ronaldo played on and even did a full length run of the pitch late on when United broke forward. He was eventually substituted in the 88th minute and walked awkwardly off the pitch. There have been fears Ronaldo would struggle to fit into Rangnick‚Äôs high-pressing style but the new boss vowed to deploy him up front. Rangnick, who faces Crystal Palace tomorrow, said: ‚ÄúYou always have to adapt your style or your idea of football to the players you have available, not visa versa. ‚ÄúHaving seen Cristiano against Arsenal in the second half at the age of 36, he is an amazing top professional. ‚ÄúAt his age, I've never seen a player who is still that physically fit. He's still a player who can easily make the difference. \n ‚ÄúSo yes, it's about how we can develop the whole team, not only Cristiano. We play in the most competitive league in the world so we need all the players on board. ‚ÄúWhat I saw from Cristiano, he is more than willing to do that, to put his input into the team. His team-mates will have to do the same.‚Äù Rangnick will not have much time to get his ideas across before tomorrow‚Äôs match at home to Palace. He said: ‚ÄúI cannot do a lot with the players that played against Arsenal because I need to make sure that they have enough power and fuel in the tanks for the game on Sunday, so physically we cannot really train. ‚ÄúSo, the only way to help them and to give them an input is mentally obviously, with regard to energy. \"Against Arsenal the second half showed that there is enough energy in the team. ‚ÄúOf course it's about video footage, showing them the right situations, telling them what they might be able to do better to keep the team away from their own box - those kinds of things.‚Äù  ‚öΩ Read our Football news live blog for the very latest rumours, gossip and done deals ", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/betting-tips/15779007/online-casino-offers-free-spins-no-deposit-bonus-cash/": "And you can access them right here.

The jury in Maxwell's sex trafficking trial were told the millionaire also kept photos of young girls outside the bedroom he shared with her. Maxwell, 59, is accused of preying on vulnerable young girls and luring them to massage rooms to be molested by her former lover between 1994 and 2004. The green massage table was seized from Epstein's Palm Beach mansion, where Maxwell also lived, as part of a 2005 investigation into claims he molested children. It was wheeled into the court for the jury to see as Maxwell looked on. Jeffrey Parkinson, a retired police officer involved in the 2005 search as part of the investigation, told the court he carried out the massage table. Prosecutor Maurene Comey also showed jurors a photo of a box labelled 'Twin Torpedos', another cop said contained sex toys taken from an upstairs closet. \"We were looking for massage tables, we were looking for massage oils, we were looking for sex toys, we were looking for correspondence,\" Michael Dawson told the jury. But Judge Alison Nathan, sitting in New York, ruled that supposed semen stains found on one of Epstein‚Äôs massage tables was not admissible as evidence. Earlier, prosecutors said they wanted the pictures and outfits to be used in evidence to show the millionaire's ‚Äúinterest in underage girls‚Äù. Epstein would make staff take down pictures of Maxwell when he attended his home in Florida with women and girls, the court heard today. The jury was also shown police videotape of the interior of Epstein's Florida home which will not be made available to the media or public. Shot during a 2005 raid at the Palm Beach home, the footage shows the property decorated with nude photos and paintings of young women. Federal lawyers claim the decor is proof of a sexualized atmosphere encouraged by Maxwell. A photo of the paedophile's goddaughter sitting across his lap as he appears to be \"pulling her underwear\" and biting her bum was also submitted as evidence. According to prosecution lawyers, the photo hung outside his bedroom in Palm Beach which he shared with Maxwell. The picture was found in 2005 by cops during the FBI raid. Prosecutor Maurene Comey said it showed a \"deeply disturbing oversexualizing of a young girl\". Another prosecutor Alison Moe said the schoolgirl outfits found at the mansion \"speaks to a preference for underage girls\". She said: \"Schoolgirl costumes, small ones, were found on the same floor of the house by the massage rooms where underage girls were abused.\" Following Epstein's arrest in 2019, police found a \"vast trove\" of nude photos at his New York mansion along with CDs of images showing girls who were underage. However, this is the first time it has emerged the sex offender kept schoolgirl outfits at one of his homes. The government alleges Maxwell groomed girls by taking them on shopping trips and movie outings and encouraging them to accept financial help from Epstein. It is also alleged she talked to the girls about sex and encouraged them to give Epstein massages. She denies all the allegations. The financier‚Äôs former housekeeper Juan Alessi was cross-examined by Maxwell‚Äôs defence counsel Jeffrey Pagliuca on Friday, in which he described his employment as ‚Äúslavery‚Äù. He also said he wished alleged victims had complained to him at the time he worked there, telling the court in Manhattan: ‚ÄúI wish they had, I would have done something.‚Äù The housekeeper admitted driving 14-year-old ‚ÄòJane‚Äô ‚Äì Maxwell‚Äôs youngest accuser ‚Äì to Epstein‚Äôs house in Florida, and seeing Prince Andrew‚Äôs accuser Virginia Roberts there when she was ‚Äú14 or 15‚Äù. This follows Epstein's former pilot Larry Visoski claiming he thought Virginia looked like an adult, saying: \"she didn't look young.\" The prosecution submitted two pictures of the alleged sex slave as evidence today. Mr Alessi confirmed he was handed a household manual by ‚Äúlady of the house‚Äù Maxwell when he managed Epstein‚Äôs Palm Beach home between 1994 and 2002. GHISLAINE Maxwell faces six charges over her alleged involvement with Jeffrey Epstein: The highly-detailed 58-page booklet, which was written by a ‚Äúcountess‚Äù, the court heard, was released today. It told Epstein‚Äôs staff to ‚Äútry and anticipate the needs of Mr Epstein, Ms Maxwell and their guests‚Äù, adding: ‚ÄúDo not discuss personal problems with guests. Unobtrusive is the key.‚Äù In capital letters it told them to: ‚ÄúSMILE!‚Äù It detailed what Maxwell and Epstein liked for breakfast and even that she had ‚ÄòLady Ghislaine‚Äô note paper around the house in Florida. Lady Ghislaine was the name of the boat owned by her father Robert Maxwell who fell off the vessel and drowned near the Canary Islands in 1991. The household manual warned staff: ‚ÄúNEVER disclose Mr Epstein or Ms Maxwell‚Äôs activities or whereabouts to anyone. ‚ÄúRemember that you see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing, except to answer a question directed at you. Respect their privacy.‚Äù Mr Alessi, 71, testified: ‚ÄúIt was a warning. I was supposed to be blind, deaf and dumb, to say nothing.‚Äù The manual also specified that a gun was ‚Äúplaced in beside table drawer‚Äù in the master-bedroom shared by Epstein and Maxwell in Palm Beach home. After calling the booklet ‚Äúdegrading‚Äù, Alessi, speaking of the 24/7 work he did for Epstein and Maxwell, said: ‚ÄúIt was slavery.‚Äù Ecuadorian Alessi testified on Thursday that he had placed a ‚Äúlarge dildo‚Äù back in Maxwell‚Äôs closet and found a black leather ‚Äúcostume‚Äù in there too. The British socialite faces six charges linked to Epstein‚Äôs sex trafficking ring and has pleaded not guilty. Ghislaine appeared in court this week along with her sister Isabel, her brother Kevin and a small group of supporters. Epstein and Maxwell rubbed shoulders with the world's rich and famous - allegedly hiding in plain sight amid a web of sex abuse. Multi-millionaire Epstein would keep a \"little black book\" of powerful contacts as he jetted around the world allegedly with Maxwell. Prosecutors argue Maxwell¬†\"served up\"¬†young girls to her former lover and also allegedly participated in some of the attacks. She is also alleged to have lied under oath by hiding her participation in Epstein's offences during a separate civil case. Her lawyers¬†deny all charges¬†against her and claim she is being made a proxy for Epstein and have painted the alleged victims as money-hungry. \n", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16931769/ghislaine-maxwell-trial-victims-epstein/": "Maxwell, 59, the former girlfriend of Epstein, faces six charges of sexual abuse and trafficking - allegations she denies.  Juan Patricio Alessi, 71, who worked at the paedo's mansion in Palm Beach, Florida from 1990 to 2002, took the stand again today for the fifth day of the socialite's trial in New York City following her arrest last year. He said that the Brit once handed him a hefty booklet with a checklist detailing the tasks he was to carry out to \"maintain the house\" - something he said he found \"degrading\". The book, which was submitted into evidence and was written by a \"Countess\", the court heard, was released today showing yet more strict rules staff members were told to follow. Employees were told to \"be cautious of voice levels and noise\" while working at the property. They were also told: \"Remember that you see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing, except to answer a question directed at you.\" Staff were banned from eating or drinking in front of Maxwell, Epstein or their guests and were also instructed not to wear \"strong perfume or aftershave lotion.\" Alessi, who is being cross-examined today by Maxwell's lawyers, said this morning that working conditions at the Florida home were like \"slavery.\" He told the court that he was expected to be on call for Epstein 24 hours a day. Employees were also told items in pockets \"must not create a bulge or be visible\", with Alessi previously saying he was \"supposed to be blind and dumb\". Staff were also instructed on using \"proper language\" around the property. Words like \"yeah\", \"sure\" and right\" were deemed improper and workers were instead told to say things like \"My pleasure and \"Of course Ms...\"  On Thursday, the house manager, who moved to Florida from Ecuador in 1984, was asked by the prosecution \"how did things change\" when Maxwell became involved with Epstein. He replied: \"Things were less cordial. Less conversation. I was not allowed to see Mr Epstein anymore, unless he asked me a question. \"Ms Maxwell said, 'Don't look at his eyes, look at another part of him.'\" The former Epstein staffer - who first met the socialite in 1991 - described Maxwell as the \"lady of the house\" who called him \"John\". He said: \"From the day she came to the house she right away took over. She mentioned to me she was going to be the lady of the house. She also told me she was in charge of (Epstein's) other properties.\" One of Alessi's jobs was to stuff $100 bills into each of the millionaire's cars. When asked how any times he saw females bathing at the mansion's pool, Alessi said: \"hundreds of times.\" GHISLAINE Maxwell faces six charges over her alleged involvement with Jeffrey Epstein: Asked if the women were \"topless\", the witness said: \"75% of the time.\" Alessi said he first worked for the mother of Les Wexner before being recommended to Epstein. Wexner, who founded lingerie giant Victoria's Secret, reportedly allowed financier Epstein to manage his billion-dollar fortune from the late-1980s until at least 2007. Housekeeper Alessi - who lived at Epstein's mansion - told the court that Maxwell would sleep in the paedophile monster's bedroom when she stayed at the Florida home. The 71-year-old told police in 2005 that he would wash off vibrators and a rubber penis after Epstein's massages with girls. He said the bed sheets would be changed after each massage, suggesting there was some kind of sexual activity taking place. Giving evidence on Thursday, Alessi spoke about finding sex toys in his boss' massage room. He said: \"I remember finding a large dildo. It looked like a huge man's penis with two heads.\" Alessi said he put gloves on to wash the sex toy and the placed it in a wicker basket in Maxwell's closet which also contained pornography and a black leather costume. He told the court \"there were many photographs\" of naked women at the mansion \"usually kept at Ms Maxwell's desk\". The former staff member said that two girls, who appeared underage, also frequently stayed at the mansion. He told the court one was Virginia Roberts - who alleges she was forced to sleep with Prince Andrew three times - and the alleged victim in the trial who uses the pseudonym¬†'Jane'. The Duke of York denies all allegations of misconduct made against him. Asked how old Jane was when he first met her, Alessi said: \"Appeared 14 or 15. She was beautiful, beautiful eyes, long brunette hair, very pleasant. \"Three times she was there with her mother. Then, without her mother. Many times.\" Alessi alleges he first met Virginia when she worked at Donald Trump's Mar-A-Lago resort in Florida. He told the court: \"I was at Mar-A-Lago with Ms Maxwell. I waited in the car like the driver.\" Asked by the prosecution, \"how did she look?\", the 71-year-old replied: \"young\", and when asked how old she was he said: \"14 or 15.\" This follows Epstein's former pilot Larry Visoski claiming he thought Virginia looked like an adult, saying: \"she didn't look young.\" The prosecution submitted two pictures of the alleged sex slave as evidence today. Maxwell's¬†defence are expected to hinge much of their case on going after the credibility of the alleged victims. Her first accuser \"Jane\" took the stand yesterday on day three of the trial. She claimed Maxwell fondled her as Epstein pleasured himself before the twisted financier abused her with sex toys. Jane also told the court that an \"orgy\" took place in the mansion's massage room on multiple occasions and both Maxwell and Epstein allegedly took part. Elsewhere, defence attorneys pursued inconsistencies and apparent errors in Jane's account of the events that occurred 20 years ago when she was a teenager. She previously told how the British socialite was \"in the room\" when much of the abuse occurred - including when she was just 14. Jane repeatedly said she could either not recall or claimed there were errors in the initial transcription of her comments when speaking to prosecutors in 2019. It appears a key part of Maxwell's defence lawyers strategy is attempting to suggest the victim's memories have changed over time. Jane, now in her early 40s and an actress, was also grilled about a multimillion dollar payout she received from a compensation fund for Epstein's victims. Sobbing, she said: \"I wish I never received that money in the first place because of what happened.\" Maxwell's lawyers also quizzed her on her career as an actress, including asking if she even played a \"prostitute\" and if she can \"cry on command\". \"This is real. I am seeking closure. I have been running from this my entire life. I want to help in whatever way I can. And maybe find some healing,\" Jane said. And she added that she clearly recalls the first time Epstein abused her as it was the moment her \"life would change forever\". During cross examination, Jane was asked by Maxwell's lawyers if Epstein had ever introduced her to¬†Donald Trump. She agreed she had and claims she was driven to Mar-a-Lago by Epstein in a dark green car when she was 14. And later on, she also mentioned she took part in a Trump sponsored beauty pageant. Trump has long been associated with beauty pageants, owning the MIss USA contest from 1996 to 2015. There has been no suggestion in the trial - or anywhere else - that Mr Trump was aware of Epstein's sickening crimes. And she was also asked if she ever remembered being on a flight with¬†Ghislaine's pal Prince Andrew, to which¬†she also replied yes. Andrew denies any wrongdoing over his friendship with Epstein - including strongly denying he slept with 17-year-old sex slave Virginia Roberts. It is the third time Trump have been mentioned in the case - and the second time for Andrew. Both were named yesterday alongside Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker as plane passengers by Epstein's longtime pilot Lawrence Visoski. And on both occasions the famous names were brought up by Maxwell's team during cross-examination. Ghislaine appeared in court yesterday along with her sister Isabel, her brother Kevin and a small group of supporters. Epstein and Maxwell rubbed shoulders with the world's rich and famous - allegedly hiding in plain sight amid a web of sex abuse. Multi-millionaire Epstein would keep a \"little black book\" of powerful contacts as he jetted around the world allegedly with Maxwell. Prosecutors argue Maxwell¬†\"served up\"¬†young girls to her former lover and also allegedly participated in some of the attacks. She is also alleged to have lied under oath by hiding her participation in Epstein's offences during a separate civil case. Her lawyers¬†deny all charges¬†against her and claim she is being made a proxy for Epstein and have painted the alleged victims as money-hungry.

A picture of the tense encounter ‚Äì created by fellow sketch artist Jane Rosenberg, who was also drawn by the Brit ‚Äì has since gone viral on social media. New York-based Ms Williams revealed that Maxwell swiveled round in her chair to draw her and Ms Rosenberg a second time, at jury selection later in the month. At the time of the tense encounter, Reuters wrote in its description of Rosenberg's sketch: \"Ghislaine Maxwell, the¬†Jeffrey Epstein¬†associate accused of sex trafficking, makes a sketch of court artists while seated between defense attorneys Bobbi Sternheim and Jeffrey Pagliuca, during a pre-trial hearing ahead of jury selection.\" Speaking of the first time she spotted the English heiress sketching her, Ms Williams exclusively told The Sun: ‚ÄúIt was the first thing she did when she got into court. ‚ÄúIt was like she didn‚Äôt think anyone would notice. She stared right at us, and it was definitely an odd moment. ‚ÄúMaybe she was trying to psyche us out, or perhaps she was just missing human contact. But whatever the reason, it didn‚Äôt creep us out. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not exactly an intimidating person! ‚ÄúThe second time she did it, she turned right around to us. It was very deliberate.‚Äù Follow our Ghislaine Maxwell trial live blog for the very latest news and updates... It is the first time Ms Williams, who has covered many high-profile trials, including that of disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, has ever been drawn by a defendant. Cult leader Charles Manson used to draw his sketch artist in court, she added. Despite their frosty start, Ms Williams says that Maxwell began nodding and even waving to the sketch artists at the start of her six-week trial in Manhattan. She said: ‚ÄúShe (Maxwell) has stopped doing that over the last few days. \"Trials like this can be very hard on everybody.‚Äù In a 2020 interview with the New York Post, Rosenberg recalled her time sketching Epstein, describing the convicted sex offender as a  \"totally a sicko, weirdo.\" The sex trafficking trial of Epstein's alleged \"madam\" started on Monday. Epstein's former pilot, Lawrence Visoski, who testified for the prosecution, was asked during cross-examination about¬†passengers on Epstein's Gulf Stream plane¬†and confirmed¬†Prince Andrew and former¬†presidents Donald Trump and Bill Clinton¬†had all flown on it. \"I certainly remember President Trump, but not many people associated with him,\" the pilot told the trial. Maxwell¬†faces allegations¬†that she procured girls for¬†Epstein¬†while also participating in the abuse herself on several occasions. Prosecutors allege she and Epstein exploited girls as young as 14 between 1994 and 2004. Maxwell‚Äôs lawyers deny all charges against her and will attempt to argue her relationship with Epstein has been overstated. Do you have a story for The US Sun team?

Assistant US Attorney Maruene Maurene Comey asked the officer questions about a search warrant that was carried out at the Palm Beach estate in October 2005. Maxwell reportedly showed no reaction as the table was examined. This comes after the first accuser, identified only as Jane, took the stand earlier this week, alleging that Epstein asked for frequent massages during which sex toys would be used. One Palm Beach police offer alleged that the \"Twin Torpedo\" sex toys were found in a closet in Epstein's estate. Read our Ghislaine Maxwell live blog for the latest news and updates... MAXWELL WAS ‚ÄòVERY CASUAL,‚Äô SAYS ALLEGED VICTIM On one occasion, alleged victim ‚ÄúJane‚Äù said she watched as Epstein fondled himself as Ghislaine ‚Äúrubbed‚Äù and ‚Äúkissed‚Äù him, the court heard. ‚ÄúShe was very casual, like this was entirely normal. I was confused. When you are 14 you have no idea what is going on,‚Äù she said. She also claimed on one occasion she saw Maxwell and four other women topless by a pool. And in another instance she was brought up to Epstein‚Äôs bedroom at his mansion in Palm Beach. ‚ÄúThey moved me over to the bed and took their clothes off. And they started to sort‚Äôve like fondle each other,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey asked me to take my top off. Then there were hands everywhere.‚Äù WHAT IS GHISLAINE MAXWELL ACCUSED OF? Maxwell has been accused of grooming teenage girls for the late Jeffrey Epstein to abuse. She has pleaded not guilty to charges ranging from 1994 to 2004. WHO TESTIFIED ON FRIDAY? Gregory Parkinson, a former Palm Beach Police officer, and Palm Beach Sgt. Michael Dawson both testified on Friday. Both were asked questions in relation to a search warrant that was executed on Epstein's Palm Beach estate in October 2005. NEW EVIDENCE BROUGHT IN FRIDAY For the first time on Friday, December 3, new evidence was brought into the courtroom. A massage table retrieved from Epstein's Palm Beach estate, along with a Twin Torpedo‚Äù sex toy found in a closet, were examined. While prosecutors were unsure why the items were brought in, the first victim to testify this week alleged Epstein abused her during \"massages\" with sex toys, according to the New York Post. EPSTEIN HOUSEKEEPER 'ON CALL 24-HOURS A DAY' Juan Patricio Alessi, 71, worked at Epstein's mansion in Palm Beach, Florida from 1990 to 2002. The housekeeper told the court Friday that he was expected to be on call for Epstein 24 hours a day. One of Alessi's jobs was to stuff $100 bills into each of the millionaire's cars. Employees were also told items in pockets \"must not create a bulge or be visible\", with Alessi previously saying he was \"supposed to be blind and dumb\". Staff were also instructed on using \"proper language\" around the property. Words like \"yeah\", \"sure\" and right\" were deemed improper and workers were instead told to say things like \"My pleasure and \"Of course Ms...\" MAXWELL SEEN SKETCHING COURT ARTIST DURING HEARING A court sketch artist in the¬†Maxwell trial has told of the bizarre moment the socialite turned around and began to draw her. Illustrator Elizabeth Williams, who has been sketching people in court for 40 years, was at a pre-trial hearing in November when¬†Maxwell¬†began staring at her while drawing. Speaking of the first time she spotted the English heiress sketching her, Ms Williams exclusively told The Sun: ‚ÄúIt was the first thing she did when she got into court. ‚ÄúIt was like she didn‚Äôt think anyone would notice.

But whatever the reason, it didn‚Äôt creep us out.\" EPSTEIN HOUSEKEEPER DESCRIBES EMPLOYMENT AS 'SLAVERY' Epstein's former housekeeper Juan Alessi was cross-examined by Maxwell‚Äôs defence counsel Jeffrey Pagliuca on Friday, in which he described his employment as ‚Äúslavery‚Äù. He also said he wished alleged victims had complained to him at the time he worked there, telling the court in Manhattan: ‚ÄúI wish they had, I would have done something.‚Äù WILL THERE BE ANOTHER TRIAL? The trial currently underway is addressing the six counts in connection to an alleged sex trafficking scheme with Jeffrey Epstein. Ghislaine Maxwell was also charged with two counts of perjury in connection to a sworn deposition. There will be a separate trial for those charges, which has yet to be scheduled. WHAT IS THE ‚ÄòLITTLE BLACK BOOK‚Äô? Prosecutors allege that an address book containing the contact information of the alleged victims belonged to Maxwell, and that she and Epstein used it. The court will hear testimony about the book from a former employee at Epstein‚Äôs Palm Beach mansion. The judge said after hearing the testimony, she will then decide if the jury can see any of the book. PILOT CLAIMS FORMER PRESIDENTS TRAVELED ON EPSTEIN‚ÄôS PLANE Lawrence Visoski, Epstein‚Äôs former pilot who is testifying for the prosecution, was asked during cross examination this week about passengers aboard Epstein‚Äôs Gulf Stream plane. He¬†confirmed¬†former President Donald¬†Trump,¬†Prince Andrew, and former¬†President Bill Clinton¬†had all flown on it. ‚Äì along with other big names like Kevin Spacey, Chris Tucker and violinist Itzhak Perlman. He told the court he never saw any sexual activity on the flight, or any underage girls without their parents. ‚ÄúI certainly remember President Trump, but not many people associated with him,‚Äù the pilot told the trial. WHO HAS BEEN CONNECTED TO EPSTEIN AND MAXWELL? Notable politicians, billionaires, and celebrities have been connected to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwelll. Some of them include Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Bill Gates, and Woody Allen. IS GHISLAINE MAXWELL MARRIED? Yes. However, prosecutors allege that she is continuing to conceal who she is married to. Evidence points to her husband being millionaire tech company CEO¬†Scott Borgerson. Manhattan prosecutors have accused the British socialite of trying to hide her wealth. Assistant US Attorney Alison Moe told Manhattan federal Judge Alison Nathan: ‚ÄúThe defendant also makes no mention whatsoever about the financial circumstances or assets of her spouse, whose identity she declined to provide to Pretrial Services.‚Äù MAXWELL‚ÄôS LAWYER INVOKED THE BIBLE IN OPENING STATEMENT Opening the case for the defense on Monday, Bobbi Sternheim told the jury: ‚ÄúEver since Eve was accused of tempting Adam with the apple, women have been blamed for the bad behavior of men, and women are often vilified and punished more than men are. ‚ÄúThe charges against Ghislaine Maxwell are for things Jeffrey Epstein did. But she is not Jeffrey Epstein. ‚ÄúShe is not like Jeffrey Epstein and she is not like any of the other men, powerful men, moguls, who abused women.‚Äù MAXWELL ACCUSED OF PREYING ON GIRLS WITH ‚ÄòDIFFICULT LIVES‚Äô The jury of seven women and five men heard the week how the British socialite and billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein went after young girls with ‚Äúdifficult home lives.‚Äù Prosecutor Pomerantz said: ‚ÄúMaxwell put them at ease‚Ä¶all so they could be molested by a middle-aged man.‚Äù She told jurors that Maxwell and Epstein‚Äôs youngest alleged victim, who was 14 when she was ‚Äúrecruited‚Äù, did not know that ‚Äúthis man and woman were predators‚Äù. The prosecutor said: ‚ÄúThis meeting was the beginning of that man and woman targeting (the victim) for sexual abuse that would last for years.‚Äù Pointing to the defendant, Ms Pomerantz said: ‚ÄúWho was this woman? It was the defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell.‚Äù HOW LONG COULD MAXWELL FACE IN PRISON? If convicted on all counts, Maxwell could face up to 80 years in prison. Depending on how the trial goes and whether she is convicted, the 59-year-old could spend the rest of her life behind bars. DEFENSE HAS ACCUSED ALLEGED VICTIM OF LYING FOR CASH Maxwell has previously claimed that one alleged victim, Annie Farmer, fabricated her accusations because she wanted money. One of Maxwell‚Äôs lawyers wrote: ‚ÄúThe fact that plaintiff seeks money from the estate and from Ms Maxwell in the millions of dollars at the same time she is a government witness in an upcoming criminal trial on the same topic is reason enough to suspect that her newly asserted memories of abuse without corroboration are not based on the truth or a desire for ‚Äòjustice‚Äô, so much as her desire for cash.‚Äù WHEN DID JEFFREY EPSTEIN BECOME A CONVICTED SEX OFFENDER? Epstein became a convicted sex offender in 2008, after he pleaded guilty to two state prostitution charges. He was charged again in 2019 with allegedly running a sex-trafficking enterprise out of his homes in Manhattan, New York, and Palm Beach, Florida. EPSTEIN 'KEPT PHOTOS OF YOUNG GIRLS OUTSIDE BEDROOM' The jury in Maxwell's sex trafficking trial were also told Epstein kept photos of young girls outside the bedroom he shared with her. A photo of a girl sitting across his lap as he appears to be \"pulling her underwear\" and biting her bum was submitted as evidence during the trial. According to prosecution lawyers, the photo hung outside his bedroom in Palm Beach which he shared with Maxwell. The picture was found in 2005 by cops during the FBI raid. Prosecutor Maurene Comey said it showed a \"deeply disturbing oversexualizing of a young girl.\" THE ‚ÄòLOLITA EXPRESS‚Äô The Boeing 727 is said to have played host to Epstein‚Äôs VIP pals including Bill Clinton and Donald Trump. It became part of the evidence on Tuesday at the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, the Brit socialite¬†accused of ‚Äúserving up‚Äù girls for Epstein to abuse. Pilot Larry Visoski told a Manhattan court Maxwell was Epstein‚Äôs ‚Äúnumber two‚Äù and would often contact him to schedule flights. ¬†MAXWELL WAS ‚ÄòVERY CASUAL,‚Äô SAYS ALLEGED VICTIM On one occasion, alleged victim ‚ÄúJane‚Äù said she watched as Epstein fondled himself as Ghislaine ‚Äúrubbed‚Äù and ‚Äúkissed‚Äù him, the court heard. ‚ÄúShe was very casual, like this was entirely normal. I was confused. When you are 14 you have no idea what is going on,‚Äù she said. She also claimed on one occasion she saw Maxwell and four other women topless by a pool. And in another instance she was brought up to Epstein‚Äôs bedroom at his mansion in Palm Beach. ‚ÄúThey moved me over to the bed and took their clothes off. And they started to sort‚Äôve like fondle each other,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey asked me to take my top off. Then there were hands everywhere.‚Äù ‚ÄòSENSATIONAL AND IMPURE‚Äô Sordid and salacious details about Maxwell‚Äôs sex life could emerge during the case as victims take the stand. Documents relating to her private life have been unsealed in preparation for the case. While others were deemed too ‚Äúsensational and impure‚Äù to be released to the public by the judge. ‚ÄúThose portions of the transcript, which were redacted in the civil matter, concern privacy interests and their disclosure would merely serve to cater to a ‚Äòcraving for that which is sensational and impure‚Äô,‚Äù¬†said Judge Alison Nathan. And with these mystery documents hanging over the trial, it raises the questions about what sleazy claims could be made in court about Maxwell. Her lawyers have previously moaned about the focus on her sex life ‚Äì claiming some parts such as details about sex toys and ‚Äúthree-way sexual activity‚Äù ‚Äì are private. MYSTERY OF EPSTEIN'S MONEY Mystery continues to loom over how Epstein made a lot of his money - with the financier believed to have been worth around $577million when he died. He took many secrets of his business dealings to the grave, but throughout the trial more details about his money could emerge. Epstein Victims‚Äô Compensation Program has awarded a total of $125million to 135 victims. And Maxwell's lawyers may attempt to undermine their credibility by claiming they simply after more cash. MYSTERY OF ‚ÄòHIDDEN CAMERAS‚Äô AT EPSTEIN HOME It has long been reported and rumoured that Epstein and Maxwell had a complex networks of cameras and recording devices. The multi-millionaire is alleged to have had these set up at his many homes around the world, and its speculated it could have been part of a blackmail plot. However, the existence of any footage from these cameras have never emerged. Details about this could emerge during the court case as part of victim's testimony, with alleged victim Annie Farmer's sister Maria making such claims. Maria is not part of the case against Maxwell, but also alleges she was abused by the duo. Farmer claims large rooms at Epstein's sprawling Zorro Ranch were for housing computers and video equipment for a surveillance network. 'YOU SEE NOTHING, HEAR NOTHING, SAY NOTHING' Employees at Epstein's Florida mansion were told to \"be cautious of voice levels and noise\", according to a 58-page handbook which an employee claims he was given. The book, which was submitted into evidence and was written by a \"Countess\", the court heard, was released Friday showing yet more strict rules staff members were told to follow. Employees were also told: \"Remember that you see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing, except to answer a question directed at you.\" WHAT IS GHISLAINE MAXWELL‚ÄôS NET WORTH? The British socialite is worth an estimated ¬£7.4million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. The New York Post reported in 2000 that Maxwell lived off an ¬£80,000 a year trust fund set up by her father.", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/16894789/queen-elizabeth-prince-harry-news-meghan-markle-royal-family/": "\"I think this is a turning point. There are all sorts of subtle messages that are conveyed in this kind of soap opera that goes on,\"  Andersen told Us Weekly. \"In 2018, she sat there in front of a Christmas tree. She gave her Christmas address and there were the family photos [‚Ä¶] Including Archie and Meghan and Harry, very prominently displayed.\" A source close to Harry revealed that it could have been one of the final issues that pushed the Sussexes to distance themselves from the rest of the royals. The royal writer added: \"I think that was hurtful [for him to see]. A friend of Harry's told me that he felt that he was being erased in a sense from the family. And it was right after that, that they made their [decision to leave the U.K.]. I think that was one of the things that prompted them to issue the statement that they were stepping back from royal [life for a] full-time real life.\" Read our royal family live blog for the latest news and updates...  The¬†Duke and Duchess of Cambridge¬†must adhere to a dress code when they‚Äôre out and about at informal events, too. For women, a smart day dress or trousers teamed with a blazer is deemed acceptable, while men opt for a collared shirt with chinos. Wills is often seen in the smart day trousers, but has on occasion broken the rules and worn jeans. Etiquette expert Grant Harrold, known as The Royal Butler, told the¬†BBC: ‚Äú‚ÄùMany places will not allow jeans as they are still seen as very casual wear, so it is better to play safe for both sexes. ‚ÄúBut if the duchess is outside walking the dogs for example, then jeans are fine.‚Äù Queen Victoria‚Äôs 141-year-old XXL nightdress and chemise are expected to fetch thousands of pounds at auction after they were gifted to a royal maid in the 1800s. The voluminous lace night garments were worn by Britain‚Äôs longest serving monarch after she gained weight following the death of Prince Albert. They were given to a retiring maid who served the royal family in the 1800s before being kept by automotive pioneer Hubert Noel Charles who designed the first MG car. Hubert‚Äôs niece Hilary Aston, 79, is now selling the regal nightwear, which could fetch up to ¬£11,000 when they go under the hammer on December 7. The retired former language school owner, from Oxford, said: ‚ÄúThis nightdress was given to me by my uncle and aunt before they died.‚Äù Prince William and Kate Middleton could welcome Princess Eugenie or Princess Beatrice as their neighbour in Kensington Palace, a royal historian has said. Marlene Koenig, a royal historian and expert, has suggested that either Princess Beatrice or Eugenie could be lined up as Apartment 1‚Äôs newest tenants. She told Express.co.uk last month: ‚ÄúPrincess Anne‚Äôs home is her own and it will go to her kids, it‚Äôs not a royal home. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an area next to it that Mark Phillips helped buy before the divorce, and that‚Äôs where¬†Zara and Peter¬†live and have their homes ‚Äî it‚Äôs all going to be theirs at some point. ‚ÄúBut other homes and royal residences, right now, it‚Äôs more about maintaining what they have. William Hanson claims that¬†shorts on young boys¬†are a silent British class marker and trousers are deemed ‚Äúsuburban‚Äù ‚Äì something no self-respecting royal would want to be considered. He told The Sun Online: ‚ÄúNot only does The Duchess of Cambridge have to worry about dressing herself but she has to dress her own children appropriately. ‚ÄúShe has to find a balance between royal tradition, heritage and more proletariat customs, such as the ‚Äòsuburban‚Äô habit of making young boys wear trousers.‚Äù William said the dress code harks back to historic traditions that state ‚Äúshorts are for little boys, trousers are for men‚Äù and he probably won‚Äôt wear trousers until he‚Äôs around seven or eight years old. Although he did break with tradition at his uncle‚Äôs wedding by¬†wearing trousers. The¬†Queen is rarely seen without her gloves, which are often Michael Jackson-esque white or a dark-toned leather to match her handbag. The monarch wears these for practical reasons during the daytime as she is frequently required to shake hands with hundreds of people. This fashion item helps stop germs being spread from person to person. Long opera gloves are worn for formal evening events such as state banquets. Piers tweeted Harry and Meghan ‚Äúbullied‚Äù the Queen into allowing them to leave the¬†Royal Family. He wrote on social media: ‚ÄúBREAKING: Harry/Meghan have successfully bullied the Queen into letting them have their cake & eat it.‚Äù Before the talks he branded Prince Harry a ‚Äúwhiny, entitled parody of himself‚Ä¶ bullying¬†Queen¬†into a woke monarchy.‚Äù He went on to call the couple ‚Äútwo spoiled brats‚Äù whose behaviour towards the Queen is ‚Äúutterly outrageous‚Äù, again attacking the¬†10-year veteran army captain Harry, calling him ‚Äúweak, whiny and miserable‚Äù. When the pair announced their interview with Oprah,¬†Piers‚Äô outrage only increased. In¬†Brothers And Wives: Inside The Private Lives of William Kate, Harry and Meghan, a new book about the Royals, the author, Christopher Andersen, claims that it was in fact the Queen‚Äôs actions that tipped them over the edge and finalised their decision to move to California. Apparently in 2019, prior to recording her annual festive broadcast, which airs every year on Christmas day, she instructed an assistant to move a photo of Harry and Meghan out of shot. Which exact photo it was is unknown, but it is claimed that only Meghan and Harry were in the image. It is believed the photo was on a desk alongside other framed photos of Royals including¬†William and Kate, Prince Charles and Camilla, the Queen‚Äôs father George VI, and the Duke of Edinburgh, too. Prince Charles‚Äô favourite actor Antony Sher has died at the age of 72. The legendary stage actor, best known for his work performing Shakespeare, was¬†diagnosed with terminal cancer¬†in September. The Royal Shakespeare Company announced the double Olivier Award-winning actor‚Äôs death in a¬†statement¬†on Friday. The new design will join a collection of commemorative crown pieces from the Royal Mint over the years, which have celebrated the Queen‚Äôs Silver, Gold and Diamond Jubilees. Included in one of the largest collections made by the Royal Mint, the coin will be unveiled next year alongside a commemorative ¬£5 crown. Collectors of coins can register their interest to the Royal Mint to claim the commemorative 50p piece. A free press is ‚Äúone of the cornerstones of any democracy‚Äù, Downing Street has said after the Mail on Sunday lost an appeal in a privacy row with the Duchess of Sussex. Meghan sued Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL), also the publisher of MailOnline, over five articles which reproduced parts of a ‚Äúpersonal and private‚Äù letter to her father, Thomas Markle, 77, in August 2018. The 40-year-old duchess won her case earlier this year when a High Court judge ruled in her favour without a full trial. ANL brought an appeal against that decision and, at a three-day hearing in November, argued the case should go to a trial on Meghan‚Äôs claims against the publisher ‚Äì including breach of privacy and copyright. But the appeal was dismissed by Court of Appeal judges in a ruling on Thursday. The publisher of the Mail on Sunday has said it is considering an appeal to the Supreme Court. The Duke of Cambridge and Duke of Sussex have spoken to recipients of the award which honours the legacy of their mother Diana, Princess of Wales. Winners of the legacy award from the UK met William at Kensington Palace while Harry spoke to winners from across the world in a live video meeting. The legacy award was introduced by The Diana Award in 2017 to celebrate the life of the princess on the 20th anniversary of her death. An awards ceremony at Althorp House, hosted by Diana‚Äôs brother Earl Spencer, will take place on December 9. The legacy awards are handed out every two years, with William and Harry presenting the inaugural ones at St James‚Äôs Palace in 2017. This year‚Äôs recipients ‚Äì chosen by an independent judging panel chaired by Earl Spencer ‚Äì come from across the UK, Taiwan, Colombia, Germany, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and the US.

The Prince of Wales has paid tribute to Sir Antony Sher as \"a giant of the stage at the height of his genius\" following the actor's death at the age of 72. The Olivier Award-winning actor and director was diagnosed with terminal cancer earlier this year, and his death was announced by the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) on Friday. In a statement to the PA news agency, Charles said he was \"deeply saddened\" to learn of Sir Antony's passing. \"As the President of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), I had the great joy and privilege of knowing him for many years, and admired him enormously for the consummate skill and passion he brought to every role,\" the prince said. \"My most treasured memory of him was as Falstaff in a brilliant production of Greg Doran's. I feel particularly blessed to have known him, but we have all lost a giant of the stage at the height of his genius.\" It will be the first time since 1992 that a country has removed the Queen as head of state, and Prince Charles is attending an event to mark the change as his mother‚Äôs representative. The country making the big change is Barbados. ‚ÄúAs with a lot of other things, Barbados is one of the leaders of the region. When other countries see what‚Äôs happening here, and how easy it is to transition, it may lead to a domino effect where others follow suit,‚Äù said restaurant owner Zamani Moody to The Independent. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure of the impact it‚Äôll have, though, on the Commonwealth. I know with the separation of Britain from the EU, there was the thought that the Commonwealth would get stronger and a hope that the UK would pour more resources into that.‚Äù ‚ÄúDismantling the legacy of the British Empire isn‚Äôt going to happen till we have honest conversation locally on the values, systems and traditions we continue to uphold in our society,‚Äù Rene Holder-McClean-Ramirez, an LGBT+ and human rights advocate told¬†The Independent. As a member of the¬†Royal Family¬†and future King,¬†Prince George¬†has much more sophisticated taste than many of us ‚Äì and his favourite meal certainly reflects that. Speaking to¬†Femail, Aldo Zilli claimed that the future heir to the throne is a big fan of Italian food. Hearing this, you‚Äôd naturally assume the eight-year-old royal loves a pizza above all else. Right? However, Aldo insists that¬†Prince William¬†and¬†Kate Middleton‚Äòs eldest son loves nothing more than a spaghetti carbonara ‚Äì which are notoriously tricky to make. The Prince of Wales said he was \"delighted\" to formally open a new multimillion-pound development at London's Royal College of Music, during his first visit to the site since before the UK was locked down amid the coronavirus pandemic. Charles, who is president of the college, was treated to a performance on an 18th century harpsichord and viewed the world's oldest surviving keyboard dating back to the 1400s. He toured the new campus facilities, which include performance spaces, practice rooms for students, a courtyard and a cafe. The college's More Music development, funded by a ¬£40 million philanthropic campaign, has almost doubled the footprint of the site in South Kensington. Charles was fresh from his visit to Barbados this week, where he represented the UK at a ceremony that saw the island nation become a republic and end the Queen's role as head of state. Spotify bosses have given the pair‚Äôs Archewell Audio brand a ‚Äúgentle nudge‚Äù to finish the content and protect the future of the multimillion-pound deal. One source said: ‚ÄúSpotify were delighted when they signed the couple, but the lack of content has mystified them.

Her Majesty, 95, only answers her phone every time to these two chosen individuals ‚Äì and they aren‚Äôt who you would expect. Speaking on the Royally US podcast Christina Garibaldi, royal commentator Jonathan Sacerdoti revealed: ‚ÄúApparently the Queen has two people who she speaks to the most on her phones and she also apparently has a mobile phone which is said to be Samsung packed with anti-hacker encryption by MI6 so nobody can hack into her phone. ‚ÄúBut the two people she phones the most is said to be her daughter Princess Anne and her racing manager John Warren. ‚ÄúHe is the son-in-law of the Queen‚Äôs friend, the late Earl of Carnarvon and his home was Highclere castle in Berkshire which viewers of TV may know better as Downtown Abbey. ‚ÄúSo this is apparently who can get through to the Queen from anywhere in the world if he calls she answers.‚Äù William and Kate Middleton WILL send Christmas gifts to Archie and Lilibet despite their rift with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, an expert has claimed. The¬†Duke¬†and¬†Duchess¬†of Sussex are expected to spend the festive season in California while¬†Prince William¬†and¬†Kate Middleton¬†attend¬†Christmas¬†at Sandringham with¬†The Queen. In their¬†bombshell interview¬†with¬†Oprah Winfrey¬†earlier this year, Prince Harry claimed¬†Prince Charles¬†and¬†Prince William were ‚Äútrapped‚Äù¬†within the monarchy. And the television interview ‚Äì which was¬†watched by over 17m people¬†‚Äì¬†reportedly left William ‚Äúfurious‚Äù. Speaking to¬†Ok! magazine, royal expert Katie Nicholl said the¬†Duke¬†and¬†Duchess of Cambridge¬†still want to keep their Christmas traditions going. The Duke of Cambridge has followed in the footsteps of Dolly Parton and Naomi Campbell and recorded an audio walking tour to encourage the public to get active for their mental health. William strolled around the Queen‚Äôs Sandringham estate in Norfolk, sharing personal stories and music as part of the Time To Walk series featured on the Apple watch, for the technology company‚Äôs Fitness+ subscribers. Listeners are able to immerse themselves in walks featured in the series, hearing the footsteps of the narrator and the sounds around them as they take the audience on a journey through locations important to them. During the recording, made in the spring, the duke talks about the importance of keeping mentally fit, reflects on a light-hearted moment when he was drawn out of his comfort zone, the value of listening as a way to empower others, and an experience that led him to prioritise mental health. His walk takes him from the Queen‚Äôs residence, Sandringham House, past St Mary Magdalene Church ‚Äì where the royal family attend the Christmas Day service ‚Äì and ends at his nearby home of Anmer Hall. William has also picked three of his favourite songs and explains why they are important to him. PRINCE Harry and Meghan Markle have celebrated their first Thanksgiving as a family-of-four after welcoming daughter Lilibet in June. For the second year in a row, the couple have marked the US holiday¬†at their home in exclusive Montecito, California. And the family will have spent the day together before enjoying a meal prepared by Meghan. In her¬†recent interview on The Ellen Show,¬†the duchess revealed they‚Äôll ‚Äúrelax‚Äù and make the most of time spent together. ‚ÄúI love to cook, we‚Äôll be at home and just relax and sort of settle in,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our second Thanksgiving at home in California, so it will be nice.‚Äù The couple¬†moved into their home last summer¬†during Covid lockdowns. Prince Charles will ‚Äúfollow the tradition of the monarchy‚Äù in order to spare William the ‚Äúburden of duty‚Äù for as long as possible, claims a former royal butler. Former royal butler Grant Harrold told GB news: ‚ÄúI have been asked this question many times by many friends, do I think it‚Äôs possible that Prince Charles decides to not take on the position of King and step aside to pass on Prince William.¬† ‚ÄúI actually believe we would not see that happen because Prince Charles is very traditional.‚Äù In his witness statement, Mr Knauf claimed Meghan had emailed with an electronic draft of the letter asking if anything stood out as a \"liability\". The papers read: \"She also asked a specific question regarding addressing Mr Markle as ‚ÄòDaddy‚Äô in the letter, saying ‚Äògiven I‚Äôve only ever called him daddy it may make sense to open as such (despite him being less than paternal), and in the unfortunate event that it leaked it would pull at the heartstrings.\" It came at a time when Mr Markle missed his daughter's wedding after suffering a heart attack and repeatedly spoke to the media. Mr Knauf suggested she reference her dad's health problems in the letter as it is his \"best opening for criticism and sympathy\". After Meghan and Prince Harry‚Äôs shocking departure from the Royal Family, it was not immediately clear where the two would settle with their children. For some time, they lived in Canada before escaping to¬†a mansion¬†lent to them by actor and director Tyler Perry. Perry‚Äôs next door neighbor was Adele, and the singer and the Sussexes hit it off immediately. Meghan and Prince Harry then moved on and¬†purchased their own Los Angeles¬†‚Äì but still got plenty of visits from new pal Adele.", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/16892797/eastenders-spoilers-cast-iplayer-emmerdale-latest-coronation-street-news/": "Viewers were particularly irked as¬†Maisie Smith's character put pen to paper to allow for¬†another shot at a relationship with \"vile racist\" Aaron¬†Monroe.

The cold snap is set to continue over the weekend as punters brave the icy conditions to celebrate the first weekend of December. Getting into the Christmas period, it is likely to be milder than earlier in the month, with temperatures near to above normal, although some colder spells remain possible. It is likely to become more settled around Christmas and towards New Year with increased chance of overnight frost and fog during clearer spells. A four-year-old amputee hiked through snow and wind to become the youngest to scale Snowdon. Albie-Junior Thomas had his left foot amputated when he was 15 months old after he was born with a condition which made it deformed and his leg shorter. But it hasn‚Äôt stopped him ‚Äì and he‚Äôs been charging around on his prosthetic since he was two, with dreams of one day competing in the Paralympics. And on Sunday ‚Äì in the wake of Storm Arwen ‚Äì he scaled 3,560ft to the peak of highest mountain in Wales on Sunday. With snow hitting many parts of the UK, many people have been left asking... how does snow form? A snowflake begins to form when an extremely cold water droplet freezes onto a pollen or dust particle in the sky. This creates an ice crystal. As the ice crystal falls to the ground, water vapor freezes onto the primary crystal, building new crystals ‚Äì the six arms of the snowflake. The intricate shape of a single arm of the snowflake is determined by the atmospheric conditions experienced by entire ice crystal as it falls. A crystal might begin to grow arms in one manner, and then minutes or even seconds later, slight changes in the surrounding temperature or humidity causes the crystal to grow in another way. Although the six-sided shape is always maintained, the ice crystal (and its six arms) may branch off in new directions. The short answer is yes. If you are certain it is not¬†Covid¬†you are suffering with and you are well enough to leave home, you can get your third shot with confidence. It might make you feel a bit rougher than if you weren't ill, but overall it's perfectly safe - and you can emerge from¬†your sickly funk¬†safe in the knowledge you are protected against coronavirus. A cold shouldn't have an effect on your body‚Äôs ability to build an immune response to the flu, even though it is fighting an illness. NHS guidance says you should still attend your appointment even if you have a mild illness, including a common cold. The weather will be cold and frosty for western areas early Sunday. Showers elsewhere, with snow over high ground. Organised band of rain clears east Monday, preceded by snow. Wet and increasingly windy Tuesday. There will be a mixture of sunny spells and showers, the showers heaviest and most frequent in the north and west with some hail and thunder. It will still feel cold in strong and gusty winds so keep on wrapping up warm if you are venturing out today. Evening rain clearing from southern England, then a drier spell before further rain and showers move southeastwards across most parts. Turning windy in the west. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Sun is entirely blocked out by the Moon. The Sun is exactly 400 times bigger than the Moon but it's also 400 times further away from the Earth. These are the perfect ratios for the moon to completely eclipse the sun, provided the alignment on the Earth's surface is exactly right. If an eclipse will be \"total\" when viewed from any point on the Earth, it is referred to as a \"total solar eclipse\", even though it will only be a partial solar eclipse in other places.", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/16934911/meghan-markle-confronted-duchess-of-cambridge-bullying/": "Kirstie, who has close ties to Camilla, said Kate Middleton was left in tears during an argument with Meghan in May 2018. Meghan used a bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey earlier this year to claim Kate Middleton made her cry during a disagreement over bridesmaids' dresses ahead of her wedding to Prince Harry. But ‚ÄòLocation, Location, Location‚Äô presenter Allsopp told the Telegraph the Duchess of Sussex failed to mention another dispute over Meghan‚Äôs alleged bullying. ‚ÄúKate never ever loses her temper, but she found out Meghan was being rude to staff at Kensington Palace and she was angry with her,‚Äù Kirstie said. ‚ÄúThen, Kate burst into tears because she‚Äôd lost control and she did take Meghan flowers to try and patch things up.‚Äù The Duchess of Sussex fiercely denies the bullying claims -¬†and her spokesperson said she's the victim of a \"calculated smear campaign\". Kirstie is well-connected in aristocratic circles and her mother was childhood friends with the Duchess of Cornwall. Camilla is also godmother to Kirstie's brother. Over the years there have been reports of strained relations between Meghan and Kate. In 2018, it was reported the Duchess of Sussex also made Kate cry over her demands for Princess Charlotte‚Äôs bridesmaid dress for her wedding to Prince Harry. In her Oprah interview Meghan denied that and claimed it was the other way round, saying ‚Äúthe reverse happened‚Äù and that Kate had apologised to her for making her cry. üîµ Read our Meghan and Harry live blog for the latest updates In a further twist, it was reported that Kate tried to make up with Meghan by offering her flowers as an apology - only for her olive branch to be rejected. Formal allegations about the Duchess of Sussex were made a few months after she was confronted by Kate Middleton. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex‚Äôs former communications chief, Jason Knauf, reportedly submitted an email alleging unacceptable behaviour by the Duchess in October 2018. He compiled a dossier outlining allegations, which was sent to the¬†Duke of Cambridge's¬†private secretary. Meghan allegedly snapped \"it‚Äôs not my job to coddle people\"¬†after aides were  left in tears and humiliated by her \"difficult demands\". Mr Knauf claimed Meghan's alleged treatment of staff was \"totally unacceptable\", adding that she \"seems intent on always having someone in her sights\". One courtier also claimed that the¬†duchess \"governed by fear\"¬†while it was also reported there was a \"febrile\" atmosphere. Another ex-employee alleged they had been¬†personally ‚Äúhumiliated‚Äù by Meghan, whose behaviour felt ‚Äúmore like emotional cruelty and manipulation, which I guess could also be called bullying‚Äù. The Sun revealed in March that Kensington Palace were investigating claims of bullying against Meghan focused on her royal tour of Australia. The 16-day trip in 2018 is said to have been host to a series of clashes between Meghan and her staff. Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?

Only spouses and the closest relatives can know what Director K does for a living. But her kids worked out she was a spy for MI5 and confronted her with it - and she confessed.  In an interview with The Telegraph, she said: \"My kids think what I do is really cool. My kids now know what I do. They worked it out and confronted me.

But Director K, who is in her 40s, said she was impressed by her the children's efforts and the early promise they are showing as future spies.

The spy said: \"It is really easy to think of this stuff as being spy on spy, old school movies and novels territory, Cold War stuff but it really isn‚Äôt. It impacts every area of society, potentially every individual in the UK.\" And she called for a \"society effort\" to protect the UK from harm.  \"One of the reasons nobody in the media has ever previously interviewed a Director K is we do our work in secret.

Follow our Tristan Thompson live blog for the very latest news and updates... The 31-year-old sued the NBA star, 30, for paternal child support, after she claimed they conceived a baby on the night of his March 13 birthday. The athlete was involved with¬†Khloe, 37, at the time - though their relationship was short-lived¬†after the \"wild\" June night¬†where he was reportedly seen entering a room with three women before emerging \"disheveled\" 30 minutes later. In his response to¬†Maralee's child support filing, the Sacramento Kings player admitted to having sex with her \"several times\" at a Houston hotel after they attended his party together. The fitness guru allegedly \"drove him to the event in her Maserati sportscar\" before they headed back to his hotel where she \"had a special birthday surprise\" for the athlete. Tristan¬†claimed he knew the encounter would be sex, though he asserted that was the only time they were \"intimate.\" However, Maralee's lawyers have countered the statement, saying their affair began \"five months\" prior to the birthday evening in March. They added that the Texas native \"traveled to California on multiple occasions\" and continued to see the then father-of-two \"after she got pregnant.\" In Tristan's recount of the evening, he said: \"When we got to my hotel room, we immediately had sexual intercourse. Petitioner [Nichols] initiated our sexual contact and never objected to our having sexual intercourse. \"She was very awake and conscious and did not exhibit any signs that she was other than a willing participant in our sexual activities.\" The professional athlete recalled: \"We did not drink at my hotel room and Petitioner was not drunk. After we had sexual intercourse, Petitioner specifically asked me if she could spend the night because it was my 'special birthday' as she called it. \"I told her I had to get up early in the morning but she said it would not be an issue for her. After we had sexual intercourse, we went to bed. \"We were both naked sleeping with one another. Before I left the hotel, we had sexual intercourse again in the morning.\" Tristan also¬†mentioned Khloe in the documents, with whom he shares¬†his 3-year-old daughter True. Maralee filed the lawsuit against her alleged baby daddy on June 30, just days after moving from Texas to Los Angeles. The fitness instructor requested child support as well as \"reimbursement of medical expenses and pregnancy-related costs such as Lamaze classes, a doula, and prenatal vitamins.\" In the papers, Maralee has also asked that Tristan pay for costly items needed after the baby's birth, including \"clothing, formula, and diapers.\" The¬†Keeping Up With the Kardashians¬†alum has not denied that he is the baby boy's father but requested that a paternity test be completed after the child's birth. The former Boston Celtics player has asked that the court move the case to Maralee's native Texas, in order to limit the amount of his child support contributions. Tristan also raised complaints about how he was served, alleging that Maralee's legal team \"slipped through the gates\" of his Encino Hills home in front of his two children to present the court documents. Tristan is also father to four-year-old son Prince with ex Jordan Craig. Do you have a story for The US Sun team? Email us at exclusive@the-sun.com or call 212 416 4552.

Freezing feet are a common problem, but if you still have cold feet despite wearing warm, fluffy socks, it may be a sign of a medical issue. Read on for five key reasons your feet are cold. Hypothyroidism means you have an underactive thyroid and it isn't producing enough hormones. These hormones affect lots of your organs and help turn food into energy. If you feel cold everywhere, including your feet, you might have hypothyroidism. You should make an appointment with your doctor if you suspect you have this condition. Raynaud's disease means your body overreacts to the cold. When temperatures drop you may notice your hands and feet feel numb or ice cold. Your extremities may change colour too. If your hands and feet become pale or blue and then turn red and start to sting when they warm up you could have Raynaud's disease. Raynaud's can be caused by the cold when your arteries narrow due to the cold.    Stress can also cause a narrowing of the arteries. Make an appointment with your doctor if you are worried and they may be able to recommend a treatment. High blood sugar is a common problem for people with diabetes. Symptoms of diabetes include peeing a lot and infections. Cold feet can be a complication of diabetes too. These complications can include: Peripheral neuropathy  This means that the nerves in your feet have been damaged and can make your feet feel cold, while they will be a normal temperature to touch. Peripheral neuropathy can be due to autoimmune disease, lack of vitamins, some medications, alcoholism and diabetes.  Medication for this can include amitriptyline, duloxetine or pregabalin. Peripheral artery disease This means there are issues with your blood flow. Poor circulation can make your feet feel cold.  Peripheral artery disease is common in smokers, overweight people and those with high blood pressure or high cholesterol. A balanced, healthy lifestyle can help stave off peripheral artery disease. More exercise and managing your blood sugar levels can reduce any symptoms being experienced. Statins can also be prescribed by your doctor, as can blood-thinning medicines or antihypertensive.  Stress can cause your blood to be pumped towards your core and away from your extremities.  This can make you feel cold in your fingers and toes. If you struggle with stress and find it hard to manage, seek your doctor's advice. High cholesterol can lead to circulation problems which can cause cold feet. If you have cold feet it may be due to cholesterol building up in your blood vessels or because of inflammation.  High cholesterol can cause serious health issues like strokes and heart attacks, so speak to your doctor if you are worried. Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?

The Girls Aloud star was announced as the host of a 12‚Äìpart show for the BBC called You, Me & R&B With Cheryl, although only a handful of episodes aired. Now those have been deleted from BBC Sounds and further episodes have been abandoned. Yesterday, after The Sun approached reps for Cheryl and the BBC about this story, she rushed out a statement on Instagram insisting it was her decision not to continue with the series. But she didn‚Äôt mention why the original episodes had mysteriously been deleted. It couldn‚Äôt be because you‚Äôre embarrassed, could it, Cheryl? The BBC was branded ‚Äútone deaf‚Äù for choosing her to host the series, with many claiming it should have been made by a black presenter instead. Critics said it was an especially poor choice of host given Cheryl‚Äôs conviction of assaulting a black nightclub toilet attendant in 2003. A source said: ‚ÄúCheryl was commissioned for 12 episodes and it was hoped it could have been the start of an exciting new stage of her career as a broadcaster. ‚ÄúBut the backlash wasn‚Äôt pretty and she felt blindsided by it. ‚ÄúShe only made it through a third of the series and no more episodes have been made for almost three months now ‚Äî it‚Äôs done. ‚ÄúThe hope was that it could just be buried and disappear quietly, which is why the first four episodes were deleted from BBC Sounds too. \"It‚Äôs an embarrassing chapter which neither she nor the BBC are keen to dwell on.‚Äù Yesterday Cheryl wrote: ‚ÄúI decided not to record the last few episodes. It didn‚Äôt feel right to revisit it again.‚Äù When the podcast was announced in August, Cheryl said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always had a love and passion for R&B so I‚Äôm hoping listeners are transported back and absorbed in their own nostalgia too.‚Äù Singers MNEK and Becky Hill, as well as Radio 1Xtra DJs Ace and Yasmin Evans, were among those who ¬≠criticised her at the time.

It is thought that the cut could be achieved in stages, with basic rate tax thresholds dropping from 20% now to 19% in 2023 and 18% by 2024. The average annual UK salary is thought to be approximately ¬£30,368, according to the latest ONS figures. If basic rate tax charges drop to 18%, someone earning the average salary would save ¬£356 a year in income tax. The maximum you could save is ¬£760 a year, which would apply to anyone earning ¬£50,270 or more. People who earn less than the average salary would save less, and anyone earning less than ¬£12,570 a year wouldn't save anything as they don't currently pay income tax. Other possible initiatives include scrapping the 45% additional rate of tax for higher earners, reducing VAT on green energy and even raising inheritance thresholds. Sunak said in his winter budget that it was his \"mission\" to cut taxes, but a combination of increases in corporation tax and national insurance means that the tax burden on UK workers as at its highest level since 1950. However, both Mr Sunak and Prime Minister Boris Johnson are thought to be prioritising tax cuts in the hopes of securing conservative party re-election. The plan is to make any changes before 2024 when the next general election is expected to be held. The Times says that in total ten options were mooted and more detailed analysis is being carried out on three - income tax, VAT and inheritance tax. Each 1% cut in income tax would cost the Treasury around ¬£6bn, and the chancellor is said to have set aside ¬£14.7 billion to fund tax cuts altogether. But any moves to lower taxes are likely to be accompanied by tighter controls on public spending. ‚ÄúThings are tight and in order to deliver on our promise to cut taxes, we need to be disciplined on spending,\" a Treasury source told the Times. Some ministers are pushing for changes to come sooner saying that 2024 will be too late to tackle looming inflation. But not everybody is happy about the proposed cuts. The Institute for Fiscal Studies branded the plans \"indefensible\" saying that they unfairly discriminate and are too generous for wealthier individuals at the expense of poorer Brits. Paul Johnson, head of the IFS told the Times: ‚ÄúTo introduce the health and social care levy, which essentially only affects workers, then to cut income tax, which also benefits people who receive their income from rent, occupational pensions and other holdings, discriminates in favour of the wealthy.‚Äù Do you have a story for The Sun Money team?

The 25-year-old threw her across a bed and held a knife to her neck when she attempted to leave him in January this year. Bush also punched the victim and hit her with a slipper when he saw her chatting to his brother outside his home. The thug has now been jailed for two-and-a-half years after admitting controlling and coercive behaviour, assault, causing bodily harm, wounding and escape. Nottingham Crown Court heard how the woman moved into a caravan on Bush's parent's driveway after they started a relationship. But the fiend regularly flew into a rage and trapped her in a bedroom every day - only letting her out to use the bathroom in the morning. Prosecutor Caroline Bradley said: \"Her only period of respite was ten minutes each morning when she was allowed to have a shower.\" The woman only managed to escape when Bush's mum came to the house and took her to hospital. Doctors found she had a small bleed on her brain and suffered cuts and bruising. She has since been diagnosed with PTSD and believes she would have been killed if she had stayed with Bush.

Following her recovery from the virus she noticed that food which previously tasted good now tasted like ‚Äúgarbage and sewage,‚Äù ‚Äúgasoline,‚Äù or ‚Äúmold‚Äù ‚Äì indicating she may have a condition called parosmia. Cano said that she developed an eating disorder and would be sick any time she tried to eat anything. She said she is still suffering from the condition more than ten months after recovering from Covid and doesn‚Äôt know if she will ever get better. Cano burst into tears in a TikTok video she posted about her condition, with the footage picking up millions of views in just a few days. ‚ÄúI don't think anyone understands how much this affects your daily life. It's not just that foods taste wrong, I mean, it is that, but it's garbage dude, it's sewage,' she said in the video. ‚ÄúIt's gasoline. It's ammonia. It's bitter. It's mold. Imagine if all of your favorite foods tasted like your least favorite foods. It is a step further. It is garbage and sewage. ‚ÄúImagine the worst smell that you have ever smelled in your life, and it's that but everything. It's everything.‚Äù Cano also reads from an article on the condition in Healthline which said half of the people who suffer from parosmia improved within three months. ‚Äú[It can last] anywhere between nine days and six months. I am on month 10,' she said. According to the website: ‚ÄúParosmia causes things you encounter every day to seem like they have a strong, disagreeable odor.¬† ‚ÄúPeople who have it can detect an odor that‚Äôs present - but the scent smells ‚Äúwrong‚Äù to them. For example, the pleasant odor of freshly baked bread might smell overpowering and rotten instead of subtle and sweet.‚Äù Cano added that while she had been to see many doctors and had lots of tests done a solution had not been found. ‚ÄúIt was affecting me so much that I developed gastritis, where every single meal I was throwing up, I couldn't get anything down for a very long time,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúNow I can, sure, but I have a severe ED because it's not that everything tastes bad, it tastes like sewage. ‚ÄúIt's been 10 months and [one] doctor told me that if it didn't improve within a year, there's a chance that I won't ever get it back. I have two months left, and it's not going away. ‚ÄúOut of survey responders, 10 percent of people who had Covid reported having this. There is no research, there is no cure. There's just hoping.

Speaking to The Sun, Dr Ben Littlewood-Hillsdon, chief medical officer of symptom assessment tool¬†Doctorlink¬†said one aspect of Covid-19 which is yet to be fully understood is its longevity. \"Firstly, it‚Äôs important to know that ‚Äòlong-Covid‚Äô is not an official medical term, but a colloquial term being used to describe people whose symptoms go on for longer than the two-week symptom period officially recognised by WHO,\" Dr Ben said. \"As with the acute stage of the disease, the long-term symptoms are still far from being fully understood.\" In a separate video Cano talked about various foods and what they tasted like to her. She said she tried to eat two protein bars a day because ‚Äúsometimes it‚Äôs the only things she can keep down‚Äù. ‚Äù'It's not a lot of bites but it's a lot of protein so I force myself to eat it,‚Äù she said. Cano said that only a few foods still tasted normal, such as Arizona ice tea, Chai tea lattes, pulled pork sandwiches, strawberry yoghurt, most dairy items, Dr Pepper and candy. ‚ÄúIn general things that are sweet taste less horrible to me, still not fantastic but I'm not actively gagging,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúNothing makes sense, it's completely arbitrary. There's literally no rules.‚Äù For her, she said toothpaste tasted bitter and sour and even water tasted bad. In an interview with Buzzfeed, Cano said: ‚ÄúIt was a really common theme that we had developed really intense symptoms of parosmia a month or two months after we had initially gotten Covid. 'I had no idea that [parosmia] was an after-Covid symptom until I got it.‚Äù She told the outlet she would be talking to her doctor about undergoing repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the next few weeks, which is normally a noninvasive therapy used to treat depression but has been shown to ¬†help people with parosmia.

The policy has now left some pupils nervous about going to class as they fear they will catch the virus and give it to vulnerable relatives. Under current government guidelines, pupils, teachers and visitors are all advised to wear masks in communal areas such as common rooms and corridors - but not in classrooms. Elouise Gould, 33, said her daughter, Paige, has been put in \"reflection\" - a room for pupils banned from lessons - three times in just one week for wearing a face mask in the classroom. She slammed the Kent school as \"disgusting\" for punishing her 13-year-old daughter for wanting to protect herself and others. She told Kent Online: \"My daughter has had Covid three times. She has a little brother on her dad's side and gave it to him. \"To protect ourselves and others she has worn her mask in class but she has been taken to reflection each time and has been put in detention. \"But then in reflection they have to wear a mask, which is ridiculous.\" The furious mum added: \"They are taking her out of class and [stopping her] interacting with teachers and with friends. \"In reflection, they are there with a book and a bit of paper, which she could do at home - where she would be safer.\" Abbey School parent, Karly May, 32, said her son has chosen to wear a face mask to protect a terminally ill grandparent and his nine-year-old sister, who has chronic lung disease and a weak immune system. But Albie May, 15, has been put in isolation and slapped with after-school detentions for masking up in class, causing him \"unnecessary stress\". A spokeswoman for the school said masks are only recommended for secondary school pupils on public transport and when \"moving around the school and in communal areas\" - but not in the classroom. She said face masks can \"act as a barrier\" in the classroom.  She told Kent Online: \"The government is not recommending children wear face masks in classrooms, and previous national guidance has been clear this is because face masks can act as a barrier to effective communication, teaching and learning.\" The spokeswoman said students are asked to wear masks in \"reflection\" as it is \"a communal area and mixing with students from other years groups\". It comes after a harsh former headteacher, Barry Smith, sparked outrage among the school's parents after forcing their children to attend \"discipline assemblies\" and chant about good conduct. The pupils were allegedly reprimanded for not maintaining eye contact with teachers or speaking too quietly when conversing with staff. Mr Smith, who often visits troubled schools to try and turn them around, once dubbed students \"detainees\" and has a controversial reputation.

And now a US-based charity Too Young to Wed came to Parwana's rescue, helping her get out of the arranged marriage and moving her family from the displacement camp they were living into a safe house in Herat, reports CNN. \"I am really happy,\" Parwana said during the journey.\"The (charity) rid me from my husband and my husband is old.\" The charity's founder  Stephanie Sinclair said: \"This is a temporary solution. \"(But) really what we're trying to do is prevent girls being sold into marriage.\" Parwana's mum, Reza Gul¬†said the girl's father initiated the sale against her wishes. \"Of course, I was angry, I fought him, and I cried,\" she said. \"He said that he didn't have any option.\" Parwana‚Äôs family said they had no choice in selling their daughter in order to survive. She was sold for 200,000 Afghanis (¬£1,600) in the form of money, sheep and land that was meant to last only a few months. The Malik family have been living in an Afghan displacement camp in the north western Badghis province and have been surviving on humanitarian aid and earning a meagre living doing menial work. The situation though deteriorated following the¬†Taliban¬†takeover of¬†Afghanistan¬†in August and the virtual collapse of the country‚Äôs economy. Abdul was forced to sell Parwana‚Äôs 12-year-old sister months ago in order to help his family survive.

She had previously told CNN: ‚ÄúMy father has sold me because we don't have bread, rice or flour.

He said he had been trying to look for work but had been unsuccessful and had borrowed money from relatives. He added that his wife had even been begging other camp residents for food. He said: ‚ÄúWe are eight family members. I have to sell to keep other family members alive.‚Äù Qorban said he would look after Parwana as his child and claimed he had a wife already. ‚Äú[Parwana] was cheap, and her father was very poor and he needs money,‚Äù he told CNN. ‚ÄúShe will be working in my home.

It's none of your business what I'm doing with her, that's my business'.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúAs I can see, we don't have a future - our future is destroyed. I will have to sell another daughter if my financial situation doesn't improve - probably the two-year-old.‚Äù Parwana's mum said her daughter begged to return home and was allowed a few visits back in the camp, CNN reported. \"She said that they beat her, and she didn't want to stay there.\"  Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?

Despite wholesale petrol prices tumbling in November, retailers actually increased the price of a litre of petrol by 3.1p and diesel by 2.7p on average, Prices have continued to increase since record highs set in April 2012 were exceeded last month. The RAC believes the unjustified high cost of fuel is hurting drivers at the worst possible time with Christmas just around the corner. This is adding to the unprecedented pressure on household incomes, especially among the less well-off. Meanwhile, drivers are reporting that their commuting costs have rocketed, with several saying they're struggling to afford to fill up. One woman started a Mumsnet thread asking: am I being unreasonable to want to weep at fuel costs? She said: \"Filled my car up today and wanted to cry at the price of petrol. I never really cared about what petrol station was doing the best prices but I have really noticed it in the last few months, so it must be bad.\" Others were quick to respond saying the escalating prices were putting a massive strain on monthly budgets. One said: \"Completely agree! My ¬£50 commute in petrol a week is now almost ¬£90.\" Another added: \"It‚Äôs scary how much. They‚Äôre making 19p profit / litre on petrol! Even though wholesale prices have dropped they‚Äôre taking their time to pass it on.\" And a third said: \"Between petrol/gas/electric I'm really, really feeling the pinch more than usual. Not much left after paying for those plus groceries.\" Despite wholesale petrol prices tumbling 10p in November, the average cost of a litre of unleaded petrol ended the month at 147.28p.  It was a similar picture for diesel, with prices up to 150.64p by 30 November in spite of wholesale costs having fallen by 7p from the middle of the month.¬† RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams estimated that retailers are making a \"shocking\" 19p profit on every litre of fuel they sell, more than three times the pre-pandemic figure of 6p. Mr. Williams said: ‚ÄúSadly, our data shows all too clearly that drivers are being taken for a ride by retailers at the moment.  \"We can‚Äôt see any justification for the prices that are being charged at the pumps and are concerned that drivers on lower incomes who depend on their vehicles are being priced off the road altogether.  \"The wholesale petrol price, which is what retailers pay to buy new supply, dropped by 10p from mid-November, so we can‚Äôt see how any increase ‚Äì let alone a 3p one ‚Äì was warranted.\" The automotive services company is urging forecourts and supermarkets to do the right thing and cut their prices as matter of urgency. It says there is a clear argument that competition in fuel retailing isn‚Äôt working and is also calling for the government to get involved and ensure customers are paying a fair price. Mr Williams concluded: ‚ÄúWe urge the Government to intervene now. It‚Äôs a sad fact that the Chancellor‚Äôs fuel duty freeze last month, while welcome, simply wasn‚Äôt anywhere near enough to ease the burden now being placed on millions of households who have no choice but to use their vehicles.  \"It might be better for the Government to ask the biggest retailers to explain why they‚Äôre charging such high prices for fuel when wholesale prices have dropped.\" Here are some tips on how you can slash the cost of fuel: Make your car more fuel-efficient.¬†You can do this by keeping your tyres inflated, taking the roof rack off, emptying your car of clutter and turning off your air con when driving at lower speeds.

The only exception is in emergencies, when children have been lost or found, and some flight delays. Angela Gittens, director general of Airports Council International (ACI), said that many airports were trialling the silence to keep passengers calm while travelling. She told CNN Travel: \"Passengers can wind down while they wait for their flight to board in the common airside lounges, commercial, and food and beverage areas.\" But there are no final calls and no call-outs for late passengers, which has caused some passengers to miss their flights. Passengers Patrick Bury was left behind by his Ryanair flight from Bristol to Dublin.

The proposed change is part of a push to outlaw ‚Äúpublic sexual harassment‚Äù. However, calls for misogyny to be made a hate crime will be rejected - as it‚Äôs thought it be ineffective, according to sources. A Whitehall source told the paper: ‚ÄúThe Law Commission is not going to class misogyny as a hate crime because it would be ineffective and in some cases counterproductive. ‚ÄúBut it will call for a public sexual harassment offence which doesn‚Äôt currently exist.  \"It thinks this fits with other work the Government is doing on criminalising intimate image abuse and will be more productive and better in protecting women.‚Äù Laws surrounding the safety of women have been thrown into the spotlight after the kidnap and murder of Sarah Everard.

Sabina Nessa, 28, was discovered hidden under a pile of leaves by a dog walker in Cator Park in Kidbrooke, South East London, in September. Currently, the Public Order Act 1986 does not mention sexual harassment and doesn't refer to crimes with any sexual element. The Protection from Harassment Act of 1997 requires a ‚Äúcourse of conduct‚Äù that does not cover the vast majority of street comments or abuse which are one-off and opportunistic. And the Sexual Offences Act of 2003 largely requires physical contact. But now draft legislation shows the new plan will cover a range of offences - including intentionally pressing against someone on public transport, persistent sexual propositioning, making sexually explicit comments and cat-calling. Prosecutors and police would have to show that the actions caused ‚Äúharassment, distress or alarm‚Äù with an intent to ‚Äúhumiliate or degrade‚Äù an alleged victim.

RSPCA dog welfare expert Dr Samantha Gaines told the Sun Online: \"There was a huge difference in demand for dogs during lockdown as families made the most of spending more time at home.  \"What concerns us is what's happening to these 'lockdown puppies' now and what will happen to them over the coming months. \"We expect we'll see a major dog welfare crisis this year as huge numbers of dogs are relinquished to rescue centres, sold on online or even abandoned, with struggling charities forced to pick up the pieces. \"We have concerns that many dogs who have got used to having their owners at home may struggle to adapt once furloughing ends and people begin to migrate back to the office.\" She continued: \"We know that one of the major reasons dogs are relinquished is due to behaviour problems and research suggests that separation related anxiety may affect 85 per cent of dogs. \"This could result in more dogs coming into rescue centres as owners return to work and they struggle to cope. \"In addition to this, many of the puppies bought during lockdown will be approaching adolescence, a period of time where big behavioural changes can occur. \"This period does typically pass but may bring additional challenges for owners if unprepared for how best to manage their dog during this time.\" Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?

He told KHON2 News: ‚ÄúI kept looking at the head, I‚Äôm like, ‚Äòthat is not a tiger shark,‚Äô and it got closer and closer. ‚ÄúIt just kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger and I was like, ‚Äòthat is for sure 100% a great white.\" He also said that although the sight left him \"shaking\" he noticed the shark was not behaving in a threatening way.

And it happen to be in Kona and a 5 min drive from my house!!!\" Hawaii is home to over 40 different species of sharks, from the tiny deep-water pygmy shark to the massive whale shark that can reach 50ft. The most common ones are the white-tip reef shark, the sandbar shark, the scalloped hammerhead and the terrifying tiger shark. There have been seven recorded attacks in the past year, four of them coming from tiger sharks. In 2020 there were six recorded shark attacks with one being fatal. The number of attacks has risen across the world over the past years as swimmers continue to ignore bloodbath warning signs. It is estimated that over 800 people have been mauled in just nine years. A whopping 791 shark attacks have been reported between 2010 and 2019, according to data published by the¬†International Shark Attack File, with an annual global average of 80 bites. Surfers and water sports lovers seem to be the prime targets, accounting for 61 per cent of victims last year. It comes after last month a surfer shared how he lost his leg in a horrific tiger shark attack off Kauai, Hawaii. Mike Coots has since become a shark conservationist and regularly dives with the beasts in international hotspots to raise awareness. Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?

The annual chocolate tubs investigation by Which? also found a concerning level of unpredictability in the nation's favourite choc boxes. Mars' Celebrations have the least variety with only eight different chocolates, while Heroes are the pick for you if you like Eclairs and Fudges. And in terms of value, it's Celebrations and Quality Street which come out on top. A 650g box of the Mars selection costs just ¬£4 at Tesco, an average of 62p per 100g. That's an identical price per 100g to a 650g tub of Quality Street at the same supermarket. The worst value is a 240g box of Celebrations at Tesco, which cost ¬£3 - a pricey ¬£1.25 per 100g. Heroes and Roses are in between, both costing ¬£1.04 per 100g for their smallest 290g varieties at Tesco (¬£3) and ¬£1 per 100g for their massive 800g versions. Which? recommends going for a 600g or 650g tub for the best value. Nut lovers should go for Celebrations as Which? found an average of 12 Snickers per tub.  The Quality Street tubs tested had more pink fudges than any other variety, if that floats your boat. And Heroes had more double deckers and creme eggs than any other chocolate, averaging eight of each. We reported on the controversy around Quality Street's underrepresentation of green triangles, with just four appearing in some fans' boxes.

British Gas, EDF and Scottish Power were caught touting them by a Sun Money probe. Many fixed deals cost up- wards of ¬£1,800 a year for the average household, against ¬£1,277 on variable tariffs, pegged to the price cap. Providers are pushing these packages by writing to customers, advertising expensive deals on their websites ‚Äî but not the cheaper rates ‚Äî and laying on cashback if people sign up. British Gas ‚Äî the country‚Äôs biggest energy company with 12million customers ‚Äî says to ‚Äúswitch and save on your fuel bills‚Äù on its website. But potential customers who click for quotes are shown prices for expensive fixed rates, with no mention of the firm‚Äôs cheaper variable option. Existing customers recently migrated to British Gas from the defunct People‚Äôs Energy are only offered fixed prices when they compare fees. There is no explanation that it could cost them hundreds more than their current cheap variable tariff. EDF‚Äôs website quote search also only returns fixed charges, not its cheaper variable rate. It even says on the results page: ‚ÄúOur fixed tariff may help you save in the long term.‚Äù Scottish Power has teamed up with cashback websites to entice people with payments if they sign to fixed tariffs. New customers, for fixed deals only, get ¬£40 cashback via TopCashback and ¬£32.80 via Quidco. The Quidco offer says: ‚ÄúOnly fixed tariffs are eligible for cashback.‚Äù MoneySavingExpert‚Äôs Martin Lewis said: ‚ÄúBeware firms using ‚Äòfixing to save‚Äô in their marketing to move people off the price cap. ‚ÄúIgnore ‚Äòtime to fix‚Äô letters from energy firms. ‚ÄúThey are trying to seduce you into fixing. Stay on the price cap.‚Äù Suppliers insist they are losing money on variable-rate price-cap deals due to the high cost of wholesale gas. Sun Money asked British Gas, EDF, Scottish Power, E.ON and Ovo to comment. British Gas, which confirmed it is not promoting its variable tariff, said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre confident we‚Äôre meeting our licence obligations.‚Äù EDF said: ‚ÄúWe say on our website homepage and first quote page that switching is not necessarily in customers‚Äô best interests.‚Äù Here, we guide you through the energy industry‚Äôs game of stick or twist‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâand show how to play your power cards right. FIXED tariffs are always cheaper, right? Wrong. They used to be. The cheapest fixed deal is now ¬£1,650 for an average home, ¬£373 more than the ¬£1,277 price cap, which is the maximum a variable tariff can charge. Why don‚Äôt fixed deals save money any more? Record wholesale gas prices mean energy providers need to charge customers more. How can I avoid being put on a pricey fixed tariff? Ignore offers from your own or other energy suppliers to sign up. Just stay on the standard variable rate, which is the cheapest tariff available.  If your firm went bust and your new provider has put you on a fixed deal, phone the company and demand that it moves you on to the variable tariff. It should not have done that. If it refuses, complain in writing. If still not resolved after eight weeks, contact the Energy Ombudsman at ombudsman-services.org. What if I‚Äôve just signed up for a fixed deal without realising it is more expensive? Good news ‚Äì you have 14 days to cancel, without any charge. I switched to a fixed deal a month ago. How can I escape this rip-off? Switch again but to a standard variable tariff which falls under the price cap. But you may have to pay an early exit fee, which can be up to ¬£60. What is the safest way to switch and avoid expensive fixed tariffs? Don‚Äôt switch unless you are in the situation above. Use a price comparison website such as MoneySuperMarket, Compare The Market or GoCompare. Read the small print. What will happen to the price cap when it is reviewed in April? It will jump, possibly by ¬£300, pushing variable tariffs towards ¬£1,600 for an average household. Fixed deals are set to stay high. A DAD whose energy firm went bust avoided being sucked in by fixed tariff deals ‚Äì and bagged a bargain variable rate deal instead. Alex Lee Pan, 49, was shunted from collapsed Green Network Energy to EDF earlier this year. But EDF halted his fixed deal in October. Manufacturing manager Alex, who has two girls, aged five and eight, did not go straight for another fixed deal ‚Äì traditionally the cheaper alternative but now expensive. Instead, he compared prices and chose EDF‚Äôs lower-priced variable tariff. Married Alex, from Wandsworth, South London, said: ‚ÄúEDF gave me a tariff at the same price as Green Network Energy. But the deal ended in October. ‚ÄúI compared prices and found fixed deals had sky-rocketed, so made sure we moved on to the variable tariff, now cheaper than fixed deals. ‚ÄúSuppliers are businesses and need to make enough money. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs not transparent not to show the variable tariff on websites so people can compare prices to fixed tariffs. ‚ÄúIf your energy deal is ending, make sure you compare fixed prices with the variable rate. ‚ÄúAnd check advice websites for whether it would be a good time to switch or not.‚Äù Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?

Before Keegan was beaten up, he entered a verbal altercation with Tiffany's new boyfriend and friends over the petition. On the way home from the Queen Vic some of the lads beat him with baseball bats. Keegan now needs surgery for his lung - and it looks like he may need a doner.  Tiffany is shocked to hear the news but believes Aaron when he says he and his pals have nothing to do with it.

According to CNET, an eating disorder specialist and assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of California, said: \"People with eating disorders can get trapped in a vicious cycle of content related to disordered eating and weight loss.\" He told the outlet that sometimes hospital staff have to take social media access away from patients so they can recover. The leaking of internal documents from Facebook revealed that the company had noted 33% of Instagram users and 11% of Facebook users think the apps make their body image issues worse. Over 50% of Instagram users were said to report dissatisfaction with their bodies. Meta, formerly Facebook, concluded in the documents: \"Overall, there is substantial evidence to suggest that Instagram and Facebook use can increase body dissatisfaction.\" Experts think the \"vicious cycle\" of content is down to algorithms on platforms like TikTok and Instagram. If someone struggling with their weight was to seek out information about that on one of the platforms, they would then be shown content similar to this due to an algorithm picking up on their 'interest'. The more a certain topic is searched for, the more that type of content will be pushed your way. This can result in feeds being full of harmful content. Algorithms are designed to optimize and keep you on an app for longer by 'learning' your interests, even if they may be harmful to you. Critics argue this can come at a price for people struggling with eating disorders or other mental health issues. If you start seeing triggering content on Instagram or TikTok, there are ways to flag this to the app so the algorithm is taught to show you fewer posts like that. On the TikTok app, you have to long-press a video and click \"Not interested\". On the Instagram app, you can unfollow accounts that are triggering or click the three dots in the upper right-hand corner of a post and click \"Not interested\".

Scammers and hackers prey on shopping habits, festive good will and new tech to hijack your accounts. Facebook has billions of users around the world, so it's a key target for online crooks. We spoke to several cyber-experts who revealed how to stay safe on Facebook this Christmas. \"Our number one tip for staying safe while using Facebook this Christmas is to check which apps from other companies you‚Äôve used Facebook to log into,\" said Jamie Ahktar, CEO at CyberSmart, speaking to The Sun. \"Although most of these apps will be legitimate, most of us have used a dodgy quiz or game app in our time. \"And the problem is that these apps can often be used by cybercriminals to hack your account or steal data. \"The good news is that it‚Äôs a very simple fix that shouldn‚Äôt take more than a couple of minutes. \"Just head to the privacy settings in your account and clear your ‚Äòoff-Facebook history‚Äô. \"Doing this once every six months or so is a simple but effective way to improve your online security.\" Many hackers and scammers will attempt to impersonate your loved ones. This is an easy way to get cash out of you on apps like Facebook ‚Äì without even having to hijack your accounts. \"Look out for messages supposedly from friends or family asking for donations, loans, and other possible financial issues,\" Chris Hauk, consumer privacy champion at Pixel Privacy, told The Sun. \"Also, never click on the ads in your Facebook feed, as this is a popular method among scammers to separate you from your money and credit card info.\" Ultimately, one of the best ways to stay safe is to simply secure your account with a strong password. Don't re-use passwords across websites, and never choose one that's short or simple either. \"Ironically, some of the best ways to keep yourself safe this Christmas are not even high-tech,\" said Erich Kron, a cyber-expert at KnowBe4, speaking to The Sun. \"As always, passwords are a risk for most people, especially when they are reused across different websites. \"Cybercriminals know that if they get one password, it is likely to work in other places, so they work hard to trick people into giving them up.\" Cyber-expert Sam Curry added: \"In the short term, consumers should protect themselves with strong passwords and also enable two-factor authentication. \"Resetting passwords is always a good security measure, and you'd be surprised how many people today still use the password 123456 or ABCDEF,\" the Cybereason chief security officer explained. \"In this day and age, and with a more complex and diverse attack surface, this is never a good idea. \"Laziness is no excuse, as hackers prey on this and their biggest asset is patience and time.\" Looking for tips and hacks for your phone?

When quizzed about how common it is for a gun to malfunction and fire without the trigger being pulled, Davis responded: \"It doesn't. [It's] uncommon to the max!\" Davis added that he thinks Baldwin is \"full of s**t.\" In an article published on TheReload.com, firearms reporter Stephen Gutowski said that, at first glance, Baldwin's claims appear \"far-fetched\" because it's \"exceedingly rare for a gun to fire without the trigger being depressed.\" \"Modern firearms, even replicas of antique guns, have safeties specifically designed to prevent them from firing without the trigger being pulled,\" he explained. \"It only really happens when the gun‚Äôs firing mechanism is damaged, or there is a significant design flaw. \"In Baldwin‚Äôs case, though, the claim is at least somewhat more believable. That‚Äôs because the gun involved is more prone to firing without the trigger being pulled. And, even though it‚Äôs a modern replica of an antique design, it‚Äôs possible it did not include modern safety devices.\" Gutowski outlined two scenarios that he said would support Baldwin's claims, but said: \"both seem improbable.\" \"The first is is the hammer being pulled back far enough to set off a round but not far enough to catch a sear. That's a real hard sell,\" Gutowski tweeted. \"The next scenario is some sort of mechanical issue with the gun itself. Something that kept the sears from engaging the hammer. But, that should've been pretty easy to spot by anyone handling the gun. It would be clear it was broken.\" In summary, Gutowski wrote: \"It's much more likely the trigger was depressed while Baldwin was manipulating the hammer. Or, he just pulled the trigger after the hammer was cocked. That is the most plausible explanation in all of this.\" Baldwin told ABC's George Stephanopoulos that moments before the fatal shooting, on October 21, he and Hutchins had met to discuss the particulars of an upcoming scene, in which his wounded character draws his revolver on two foes who have cornered him inside a church. During rehearsal in Sante Fe, New Mexico, Baldwin said the film‚Äôs first assistant director, Dave Halls, handed him a revolver and told him it was \"cold\" - meaning it was meant to be either unloaded or loaded with non-firing dummy rounds. With the gun grasped in his hand, Baldwin said he and Hutchins began blocking out the scene, with Hutchins allegedly directing his every move.  \"Everything was at her direction. This was a marking rehearsal,\" Baldwin said. \"And [Hutchins] says to me, ‚ÄòHold the gun lower. Go to your right. Okay, right there. All right, do that. Now show it a little bit lower.‚Äô And she's getting me to position the gun.‚Äù Eventually, Baldwin said he ended up aiming the gun right below her armpit, which is where he claims Hutchins told him that \"she wants me to hold [it].\" He then said he needed to cock the gun - but not fire it - in order to get the shot.  ‚ÄúThe trigger wasn't pulled. I didn't pull the trigger,\" the 63-year-old said.  \"I cock the gun. I go, ‚ÄòCan you see that? Can you see that? Can you see that?‚Äô \"And then I let go of the hammer of the gun, and the gun goes off. I let go of the hammer of the gun, the gun goes off.‚Äù When asked by Stephanopoulos to clarify if he ever pulled the trigger, Baldwin responded: \"No, no, no, no, no. I would never point a gun at anyone and pull a trigger at them.‚Äù Baldwin's version of events was corroborated by Halls' attorney, Lisa Torraco, who told the network her client said \"from day one\" that he was watching from a few feet away and ‚Äúthe entire time Baldwin had his finger outside the trigger guard parallel to the barrel ‚Ä¶ that Alec did not pull that trigger.\" After cocking the hammer, Baldwin recalled hearing a loud bang and watching Hutchins drop to the floor.  \"I thought to myself, ‚ÄòDid she faint?‚Äô‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe notion that there was a live round in that gun did not dawn on me till probably 45 minutes to an hour later.‚Äù Hutchins had in fact suffered a single gunshot wound to the chest. Director Joel Souza, who had been standing directly behind Hutchins, was shot in the shoulder. Baldwin said he stood over Hutchins, paralyzed by shock for around 60 seconds before being ushered out of the room.  He was later summoned to the Sante Fe Sheriff's Office where he was shown an image of the bullet that had struck Hutchins and Souza. It was also there that he learned Hutchins had died.  ‚ÄúAt the very end of my interview with the sheriff's department ‚Ä¶ they said to me, ‚ÄòWe regret to tell you that [Hutchins] didn't make it,‚Äô‚Äù Baldwin said. ‚ÄúThey told me right then and there.‚Äù Baldwin claims he had no idea how a live round came to be on set. He said: \"Someone put a live bullet in a gun, a bullet that wasn't even supposed to be on the property. \"Someone is ‚Äãresponsible for what happened, and I can't say who that is, but I know it's not me.\" Much of the public scrutiny surrounding the tragedy on the set of Rust just over a month ago has been centered around the production's 24-year-old armorer and prop master, Hannah Gutierrez Reed. Gutierrez Reed, who had only worked as an armorer on one other film prior, was in charge of maintaining, handling, loading, and unloading any weapons on set.  During Thursday's interview, Baldwin was asked whether he believed Gutierrez Reed was qualified for the position. ‚ÄúI assumed because she was there and she was hired she was up for the job,‚Äù Baldwin, a co-producer of the move, responded. ‚ÄúI mean, I'm not a producer that hires the crew.‚Äù Bill Davis previously called Gutierrez Reed's credentials into question to The Sun, accusing her of \"flagrant negligence\" and insisting she, Baldwin, and Halls could all likely face criminal charges. \"People that were in positions of power on this set, like our prop mistress, shouldn't have been. She's only 24-years-old and by law, in America, you have to be 21 to handle firearms,\" he said. \"I have never met this young lady, I don‚Äôt know her from Adam, but what I can tell you is she screwed up and now someone is dead. It‚Äôs as simple as that.\" He continued: \"Heads are going to roll ... If I was the armorer on that set I would be expecting to face criminal charges.  \"The cops have a shot at going after her for negligent homicide because she was negligent. \"Those charges would probably be brought down to manslaughter and it‚Äôs possible that Baldwin could get that too, but I really doubt it because of his name and the Hollywood community will rally behind him - even though he hasn‚Äôt made too many friends lately.¬† \"Also the first assistant director - he‚Äôs the one who took the gun off the table, and he‚Äôs not even qualified to handle it. I bet he couldn‚Äôt name one part of that gun, yet he‚Äôs the one who handed it to the actor,\" he claimed. \"It makes no sense.\" Baldwin also sowed doubt on his chances of facing criminal charges on Thursday. \"I've been told by people who are in the know, in terms of even inside the state, that it's highly unlikely that I would be charged with anything criminally,‚Äù he told ABC. When asked if he felt guilt, he said he didn't, adding: \"I might have killed myself if I thought I was responsible, and I don't say that lightly.\" Baldwin, however, continued that Hutchin's death has left him emotionally scarred and weighs heavily on his mind.  ‚ÄúI have dreams about this constantly now,‚Äù Baldwin said. ‚ÄúI go through my day, and I make it through the day. Then I collapse at the end of the day. Emotionally, I collapse.‚Äù The 41-year-old rising star's death has also prompted him to consider whether he should bring an abrupt end to his 40-year movie career. ‚ÄúI couldn't give a s**t about my career anymore,‚Äù he said. \"It could be [over].\" In the meantime, Baldwin said he's determined to get answers for Hutchins' husband Mathew, and her nine-year-old son, with whom he has shared emotional meetings. Recounting their first meeting to ABC, Baldwin said: \"I didn't know what to say. \"[Matthew] hugged [me] and he goes, like, ‚ÄòI suppose you and I are going to go through this together,‚Äô he said. And I thought, ‚ÄòWell, not as much as you are.‚Äô‚Äù While insisting he wasn't a victim, Baldwin characterized the tragic on-set mishap as the worst thing that's ever happened to him.  \"Yes - because I think back and I think of what could I have done? \"[Hutchins] was someone who was¬†loved by everyone¬†who worked with [her] and liked by everyone who worked with [her], and admired...,\" he continued, breaking down in tears. \"I mean, even now I find it hard to believe that [she's gone]. It doesn't seem real to me.\" Hutchins was regarded as a¬†rising star in¬†the film industry, having begun her career in 2012. The 41-year-old was best known for her work on films such as Archenemy, Darlin‚Äô, and Blindfire. The investigation into her death remains ongoing. The tragedy has also renewed calls for better safety practices on sets with regards to the use of weapons and black rounds. Baldwin has said he believes police officers should be present on \"every film/TV set that uses guns, fake or otherwise\" to monitor weapons safety. Do you have a story for The US Sun team?

In a video shared to his TikTok page, the OGHacktivist showed himself arriving at a department store, where he picked up a load of grey, crushed velvet curtains.  Taking them home, he then proceeded to carefully take the old coverings off his sofa, before using a staple gun to secure the curtains in place over the cushions.  Once finished, the couch looked virtually brand new, with the crushed velvet working perfectly to cover up the bedraggled cushions underneath.  \"Everyone says they love my new couch lol,\" he captioned the video.  And viewers agreed, taking to the comments section to praise the DIYer for his hack.  \"Damn I‚Äôm an upholsterer and that‚Äôs decent work,\" one person wrote, while another added: \"Not gonna lie, I would never have thought to do that.\" Others said the hack had prompted them to try a similar method of restoring their sofa, with one person commenting: \"Me going to get deep green velvet from the fabric store.  \"I WANT A GREEN VELVET COUCH SO BAD.\" Elsewhere in the comments section, the OGHacktivist revealed he had no choice other than to give the couch a makeover. \"I had to do something, it was such an eyesore,\" he explained.

The monster regularly targeted musically gifted but ‚Äúvulnerable‚Äù pupils with personal problems who put their trust in him. Victims at two secondary schools in North Lanarkshire and Fife said he was initially a ‚Äúfun teacher‚Äù and a ‚Äúfather figure‚Äù. But jurors heard how he quickly exploited his position of trust and abused the girls between 2006 and 2017. Birch‚Äôs first victim told how the manipulative teacher started ‚Äúbigging her up‚Äù and made her feel better about herself. He claimed to be a part-time photographer and suggested taking photos of her to boost her self-esteem - but he instead went to her home and raped her. He handcuffed the youngster and left her feeling ‚Äúdisgusted‚Äù during the sex attack. The sick predator then turned his attention to another girl and had sex with her at his Edinburgh flat while his girlfriend was out. Jurors heard further sexual activity with the girl took place in a cupboard and while on a trip with other pupils. Birch was said to have told one teenager her ‚Äúbum looked good‚Äù, while he said another had ‚Äúcome to bed eyes‚Äù. The vile beast also said he wanted to teach sex education because he was ‚Äúso good at sex‚Äù. His final victim was a talented singer who became ‚Äúemotionally dependent‚Äù on her school‚Äôs music department and ‚Äúmassively relied‚Äù on Birch. The sicko teacher raped the youngster at his home, and then carried out a separate attack in Fife. The brave youngster reported her ordeal to a principal teacher, but was not initially believed. She later reported it to the head teacher - sparking a huge police probe. In her speech to jurors, prosecutor Erin Campbell said: \"He systematically targeted vulnerable female pupils, befriended them and positioned himself in their lives as a confidante.\" He added: ‚ÄúBirch cultivated dependences, he assured himself of the girls' loyalty by creating a culture of being their friend and a pivotal part of their support network.‚Äù Judge William Gallacher told Birch his crimes had a \"catastrophic\" effect on victims. He told Birch: \"You have been convicted of a catalogue of very serious offences against young girls. Your behaviour was despicable. You should prepare yourself for a lengthy custodial sentence.\" We pay for your stories and videos! Do you have a story or video for The Scottish Sun?

The Mirror suggested to the Beeb that there was a conflict of interest surrounding Craig's use of the phrase 'fab-u-lous', which he often says when critiquing dancers on the show. Other aspects of the campaign see Craig take different dance-inspired sleeping positions. In one, he says: ‚ÄúThe tango sleeping position is about creating some distance between your bodies, while remaining in the spooning position.‚Äù Another explains: ‚ÄúLike the Charleston, this ¬≠position is about keeping your body more streamlined, so you don‚Äôt spread out like a starfish and take up most of the bed.‚Äù A BBC insider reportedly said the campaign \"clearly mimicked\" his Strictly role, however, Craig's rep vehemently denied this was the case. While the 'fab-u-lous' element has been removed, the other dances aren't exclusive to Strictly. They said: ‚ÄúCraig is a ¬≠professional dancer and choreographer and has been, long before his involvement in Strictly. \"He was asked to create these sleep positions for the campaign due to his ¬≠profession and expertise as a ¬≠choreographer and dance creator, a role he doesn‚Äôt have on Strictly. üíÉFollow our Strictly Come Dancing live blog for all the latest updates  ‚ÄúThe dances identified are common dance terms and not unique or exclusive to Strictly.‚Äù Craig isn't the only Beeb star to fall foul of the rules.
